SUBTITLE BY HEART BEAT

3
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,072
We have a kind. Let's do this.

4
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:46,745
That's it? Three guys?

5
00:01:46,794 --> 00:01:49,376
Two guys on the roof.
Every guy gets a share.

6
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:50,414
Five shares is plenty.

7
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:52,975
Six shares. Don't forget the
guy who planned the job.

8
00:01:53,016 --> 00:01:55,337
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice?

9
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:57,249
I know why they call him the Joker.

10
00:01:57,293 --> 00:01:58,578
So why do they call him the Joker?

11
00:01:58,881 --> 00:01:59,996
I heard he wears makeup.

12
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:01,012
Makeup?

13
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:02,743
Yeah! To scare people.
You know, warpaint?

14
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:17,475
Alright everybody, hands up
heads down!

15
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,467
I said, hands up,
heads down!

16
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:24,644
Let's go pal! I'm
making a withdrawal here.

17
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:26,594
Put your hands up!

18
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:28,490
Here comes the silent alarm.

19
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,489
There it goes.

20
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:31,500
Heads down!

21
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:36,386
Get down. I said stay
down there!

22
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:40,768
That's funny it didn't dial out to 911.
I was trying to reach a private number.

23
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:41,613
Is it a problem?

24
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:42,631
No, I'm done here...

25
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:06,490
Obviously we don't want you doing anything
with your hands other than holding on for dear life.

26
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:16,779
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

27
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:19,357
Nobody make a move! Nobody!

28
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:20,740
Stay down!

29
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:37,571
Come here!

30
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:42,818
Do you have any idea who
you're stealing from?

31
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:44,491
You and your friends are dead!

32
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:46,215
He's out, right?

33
00:03:58,965 --> 00:04:00,512
Where did you learn to count?

34
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,661
They wired this thing up with like 5000 Volts.

35
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:06,670
What kind of bank does that?

36
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:07,673
A mob bank.

37
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:10,075
I guess the Joker is
as crazy as they say.

38
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,088
Where is the alarm guy?

39
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:13,649
The boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

40
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:15,560
One less share, right?

41
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:18,728
Funny... He told me something similar.

42
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:20,289
He what? No, no!

43
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:37,452
That's a lot of money. If this Joker guy was so
smart he'd had us bring a bigger car.

44
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:42,693
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill
me as soon as we loaded the cash.

45
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,043
No, no, no, no...
I kill the bus driver.

46
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:49,396
Bus driver?

47
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:52,778
What bus driver?

48
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,930
School's out. Time to go.

49
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:00,957
Cat's not getting up, is he?

50
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:03,453
That's a lot of money.

51
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:08,850
What happened to the rest of the guys?

52
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:17,935
You think you're smart, huh?

53
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:21,207
Well, the guy that hired yous

54
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,475
will just do the same to you.

55
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:27,617
Ah, criminals in this town used
to believe in things.

56
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,101
Honor, respect! Look at you!
What do you believe in?

57
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:34,939
Huh, what do you believe in?

58
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:39,526
I believe whatever doesn't kill
you simply makes you...

59
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:43,501
stranger.

60
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:29,082
Mr. Mayor, you were elected in
the campaign to clean up the city.

61
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:30,121
When are you going to start?

62
00:06:30,134 --> 00:06:31,419
Well, Mike, I believe I already have.

63
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:33,708
Like the so-called Batman? We're
hearing that he's doing some good.

64
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:35,440
That criminals are running scared.
But I say...

65
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:37,395
Nah, man... I don't like it tonight.

66
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,211
What are you? Superstitious?

67
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:41,802
You got more chance of winning
the powerball than running into him.

68
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:44,060
That simply is not true.
I'm told that

69
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,582
Our men in the major crimes unit
are close to...

70
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:48,464
Mayor says you're closing
in on the Batman.

71
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:51,511
The investigation is ongoing.

72
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:02,564
Ever intending to see your wife
again, lieutenant?

73
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:04,877
I thought you had to go
look after your mother, detective?

74
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:06,860
Checked her back into the hospital.

75
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:08,811
I'm Sorry.

76
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:11,249
So he hasn't shown up?

77
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:12,758
I hope he doesn't.

78
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,698
I like reminding everybody
that he's out there.

79
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:17,157
Why wouldn't he come?

80
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:20,588
Hopefully because he is busy.

81
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,247
That's why we bring dogs.

82
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:42,914
Hey, my filhotinos.

83
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,014
Look what your drugs
did to my customers.

84
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:54,573
Buyer beware. I told you
my compound would take you places.

85
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,861
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

86
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:00,301
My business repeat customers.

87
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,644
If you don't like what I have to offer
you can buy from someone else.

88
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,216
Assuming Batman left
anyone to buy from...

89
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:13,625
My dogs are hungry!

90
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,743
Pity there is only one of you.

91
00:08:29,536 --> 00:08:30,491
That's not him.

92
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:50,032
That's more like it.

93
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:20,697
Don't let me find you out here again.

94
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:22,384
We are trying to help you.

95
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:23,659
I don't need help!

96
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,150
Not my diagnosis.

97
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,592
What gives you the right?

98
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:28,739
What's the difference between you and me?

99
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,212
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

100
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:41,984
He can't resist showing us
his face.

101
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:48,810
What's he hiding
under that makeup?

102
00:10:57,277 --> 00:10:59,199
Can we get a minute,
people, please?

103
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:04,510
Him again?
Who were the others?

104
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:06,099
Another bunch of smalltimers.

105
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:08,937
Some of the marked
bills I gave you.

106
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:11,376
My detectives have been making
drug buys with them for weeks.

107
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:14,325
This bank puts another draft of the mob.
That makes five.

108
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:15,936
We found a bulk of the dirty cash.

109
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,115
Time to move in.

110
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:21,389
We would have to hit all banks
simultaneously. Swat teams, backup.

111
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:23,177
What about this Joker guy?

112
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:26,211
One man or the entire mob?
He can wait.

113
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:28,587
When the new DA hears
about this, he'll want in.

114
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,917
Do you trust him?

115
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:34,267
It'd be hard to keep him out.
I hear he is as stubborn as you are.

116
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,822
It would be nice when Wayne
manor is rebuilt.

117
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:26,190
You can swap not sleeping in a penthouse
to not sleeping in a mansion.

118
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:30,444
Whenever you stich yourself up
you do make a bloody mess.

119
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:33,187
Yeah. It makes me
learn from my mistakes.

120
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:36,017
You ought to be pretty
knowledgable by now.

121
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:43,273
My armor. Carrying too
much weight. I need to be faster.

122
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,249
I'm sure Mr. Fox
can oblige.

123
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,979
Did you get mauled by a tiger?

124
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,019
It was a dog.

125
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:50,886
- Ah?
- It was a big dog.

126
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:55,497
More copycats last night,
Alfred. With guns.

127
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:57,757
Why don't you hire them
and take a weekend off?

128
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:03,238
That wasnt... exactly what I had in mind
when I said I wanted to inspire people.

129
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,239
I know.

130
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:08,215
But things have improved.
Look at the new district attorney.

131
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,322
I am. Closely.

132
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:13,342
I need to know if he can be trusted.

133
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:17,204
Are you interested in his character
or... his sexual circle?

134
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:24,770
Who Rachel spends her time
with is her business.

135
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:28,880
I trust you don't have
me followed on my day off.

136
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:30,247
If you evertook
one, I might.

137
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:34,706
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

138
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:37,671
Batman has no limits.

139
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:39,345
Well you do, sir.

140
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:41,131
Well, I can't afford to know them.

141
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:43,482
What's going to happen on
the day that you find out?

142
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,331
We'll all know how much you
like to say: "I told you so"

143
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:51,561
On that day, Master Wayne, even
I won't want to. Probably.

144
00:13:58,681 --> 00:13:59,932
Sorry I'm late, folks.

145
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:05,084
Where were you?

146
00:14:05,108 --> 00:14:06,359
Worried you'd have to step up?

147
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:08,882
Harvey, I know these
briefs backwards.

148
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:13,859
Fair's fair.
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

149
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,294
Oh yeah? You want to flip a coin
to see who leads?

150
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:17,386
It's my father's lucky coin.

151
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:19,798
As I recall, it got me my
first date with you.

152
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:21,869
You wouldn't leave something
like that up to chance.

153
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:26,156
I don't.
I make my own luck.

154
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:34,540
I thought the DA just plays
golf with the mayor or things like that.

155
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:38,525
Tee-off is 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Salli.

156
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:42,447
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham, someone must have
stepped up to run this so-called family.

157
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:50,038
Is that man in this court room today?
Could you identify him for us please?

158
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:52,258
You win, counsellor.

159
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,286
It was me!

160
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:04,875
Salvatore Maroni, is the new
head of the Falcone crime family.

161
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,138
Maroni? He is a fallguy!
I'm the brains of the organization.

162
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:11,223
Order, order!

163
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:12,778
Permission to treat
the witness as hostile.

164
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:13,227
Granted.

165
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,136
Hostile?
I'll show you hostile!

166
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,546
Carbon fiber,
.28 caliber, made in China.

167
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:26,785
If you want to kill a public servant, Mr. Maroni,
I recommend you buy American.

168
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:29,651
Get him out of here!

169
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,235
But, your honor, I'm not done!

170
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:36,652
We will never be able to link
the gun to Maroni,

171
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,670
so we won't be able to
charge him, but the fact

172
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:41,245
they are trying to kill you,
means we are getting to them.

173
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:44,591
Well I'm glad you're so pleased Rachel.
And I'm fine, by the way.

174
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:47,175
Come on Harvey, you are Gotham's DA!
If you are not getting shot at...

175
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,699
you're not doing your job right.

176
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:53,826
But you know, he said if you were rattled
you could take the rest of the day off.

177
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:57,466
I can't. I dragged the Head of
the major crimes unit down here.

178
00:15:57,577 --> 00:16:01,468
Jim Gordon? He's a friend actually,
try to be nice!

179
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:13,506
I hear you got a
hell of a right cross.

180
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:19,510
It's a shame Sal's gonna walk.

181
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:20,966
Yeah, well good thing about the mob is...

182
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,674
They keep giving you second chances.

183
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:33,274
Lightly radiated bills.
Fancy stuff for a city cop.

184
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:34,105
Have helped?

185
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:36,221
We have links with various agents...

186
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:38,023
Save it Gordon, I want to meet him.

187
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:41,679
Official policy is to arrest the
vigilante known as Batman on sight.

188
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:44,266
Uhum... And what about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

189
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,090
If you've got problems
with malfunctioning equipment,

190
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,415
I suggest you take them up
with maintenance counselor.

191
00:16:50,064 --> 00:16:52,919
I put every known money launderer
in Gotham, behind bars,

192
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:54,536
but the Mob is still getting its money.

193
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,430
I think you and your friend,
have found the last game in town

194
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,900
and are trying to hit them where it hurts:
Their wallets. That's bold.

195
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,687
You gonna count me in?

196
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:09,251
In this town the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

197
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,853
Gordon, I don't like that you've got your
own special unit and

198
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,835
I don't like that is full of cops
I investigated at internal affairs.

199
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:19,440
If I had to work with cops you investigated while you
were licking your name at IAIP working alone.

200
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,121
I don't get political points
for being an idealist.

201
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:23,968
I have to do the best I can
with what I have.

202
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:30,178
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure

203
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,498
on five banks without telling
me what we're after?

204
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:37,458
Well, I can give you
the names of the banks.

205
00:17:37,986 --> 00:17:39,135
Well, that's a start.

206
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:42,235
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

207
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:46,727
You don't have to sell me, Dent. We all
know you're Gotham's white knight.

208
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,849
I heard they have a different name
for me down at MCU.

209
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:52,994
I wouldn't know about that.

210
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:57,862
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

211
00:17:58,095 --> 00:18:02,020
The joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

212
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:06,874
Well, Mr Lau. I speak
forthe rest of the board...

213
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,854
And Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

214
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:20,207
Sir, I know that Mr. Wayne is curious
about how his trust fund gets replenished

215
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:22,194
But frankly...
This is embarrasing!

216
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:24,487
You worry about the delegace,
Mr. Reese.

217
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:26,697
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

218
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,947
It's done.
The numbers are solid.

219
00:18:31,264 --> 00:18:35,621
Do them again. Wouldn't want the
trust fund to run out now, would we?

220
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:44,061
Another long night? This joint venture
was your idea and the consultants love it.

221
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:48,620
But I am not convinced. Lau's company
has grown by 8% anually like clockwork.

222
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:53,073
His revenue stream must be
off the books. It may be even illegal.

223
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,327
OK, cancel the deal.

224
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:58,027
You already knew?

225
00:18:58,286 --> 00:19:00,743
I just needed a closer look at their books.

226
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:03,031
Anything else you can trouble me for?

227
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:04,513
I need a new suit.

228
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,901
Yeah... 3 buttons is a little
90's, Mr. Wayne.

229
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,393
I am not talking fashion
Mr Fox, so much as function.

230
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:16,073
- Want to be able to turn your head?
- Sure would make backing out of the driveway easier.

231
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,858
I'll see what I can do.

232
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:25,139
It took me 3 weeks to
get a reservation here.

233
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:27,222
And I had to tell them
I work forthe government.

234
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:28,002
Really?

235
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:30,072
This city health inspector is
not afraid to pull strings.

236
00:19:30,482 --> 00:19:32,473
Rachel!
Fancy that!

237
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:35,545
Yeah Bruce, fancy that.

238
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,647
Rachel, Natasha.
Natasha, Rachel.

239
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:42,836
- Natasha, are you the...
- The prima ballerina from the Moscow ballet.

240
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:44,742
Wow, Harvey's
taking me next week.

241
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:46,924
Really?
So you're into ballet?

242
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:49,620
Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.

243
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:53,496
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

244
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:54,896
Well, I certainly hope not.

245
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:57,022
So, let's put a couple of tables together.

246
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:01,074
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.
- Oh they should. I own the place.

247
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,754
How could want to raise children
in a city like this?

248
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,279
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out OK.

249
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:09,139
Is Wayne manor in the city limits?

250
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:12,577
The Palisades.

251
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:13,709
You know as our new DA,

252
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:16,607
you might want to figure out
where your jurisdiction ends.

253
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:21,387
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

254
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:24,826
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

255
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,473
Gotham needs heroes
like you, elected officials.

256
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:29,114
And not a man who
thinks he's above the law.

257
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:31,303
- Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?
- We did.

258
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:34,977
All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

259
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,650
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

260
00:20:36,822 --> 00:20:38,335
When their enemies were at the gates,

261
00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:41,863
the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

262
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:45,219
It wasn't considered an honor.
It was considered a public service.

263
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:49,495
Harvey, the last man that they appointed
to protect the republic was named Caesar,

264
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,839
and he never gave up his power.

265
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,591
OK, fine.
You either die a hero...

266
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:57,365
or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain.

267
00:20:57,807 --> 00:21:02,232
Look. Whoeverthe Batman is, he doesn't
want to do this for the rest of his life.

268
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:04,983
Batman is looking for someone
to take up his mantle.

269
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:10,471
- Someone like you, Mr. Dent?
- Maybe. If I'm up to it.

270
00:21:10,493 --> 00:21:14,975
- What if Harvey Dent is
the caped crusader?

271
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:20,890
- If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would have noticed by now.

272
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:27,580
Well... I'm sold that I'm going
to throw you a fundraiser.

273
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:30,818
That's nice of you Bruce, but
I'm not up for reelection for 3 years.

274
00:21:30,987 --> 00:21:34,536
No, you don't understand.
One fundraiser with my pals,

275
00:21:36,072 --> 00:21:37,790
you'll never need another cent.

276
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:54,444
What the hell is this?

277
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:03,173
A relatively small amount.
68 million.

278
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,173
Who is stupid enough to steal from us?

279
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:09,682
2-bit wackjob, wears a cheap
purple suit and makeup.

280
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:11,756
He's not the problem.
He's a nobody.

281
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,444
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

282
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,826
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well placed sources,

283
00:22:17,864 --> 00:22:20,583
we know that police have
indeed identified our banks

284
00:22:20,796 --> 00:22:24,880
using marked bills and are planning
to seize your funds today.

285
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:29,266
And since the enthusiastic new DA has
put all my competitors out of business,

286
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:31,393
I'm your only option.

287
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,605
So what do you propose?

288
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:35,569
Moving all deposits
to one secure location.

289
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,758
- Not a bank.
- Where then?

290
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:39,626
Nobody can know, but me.

291
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,664
If the police were to gain leverage over one
of you, everyone's money would be at stake.

292
00:22:44,895 --> 00:22:46,886
What stop them getting to you?

293
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:49,895
I go to Hong Kong.
Far from Dent's jurisdiction

294
00:22:50,588 --> 00:22:52,840
And the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

295
00:22:53,816 --> 00:22:55,295
How soon can we move the money?

296
00:22:55,597 --> 00:22:57,110
I already have.

297
00:22:59,142 --> 00:23:01,622
For obvious reasons, I couldn't
wait for your permission.

298
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,304
Rest assured your money is safe.

299
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:20,698
And I thought my
jokes were bad.

300
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:23,631
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy here pull your head off.

301
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:25,217
How about a magic trick?

302
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:31,174
I'm going to make
this pencil disappear.

303
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:37,701
Tahdah! It's gone!

304
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:41,022
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

305
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,822
You ought to know,
you bought it!

306
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:47,600
Easy.
I want to hear proposition.

307
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:53,309
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

308
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:58,641
These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare
cross any of you.

309
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:05,224
Uh..I mean..What happened?
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

310
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:10,354
- You see a guy like me...
- A freak!

311
00:24:12,838 --> 00:24:20,324
A guy like me... Look. Listen.
I know why you choose to have your little..

312
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:26,842
group therapy sessions in broad daylight.
I know why you're afraid to go out at night.

313
00:24:28,887 --> 00:24:35,781
The Batman. You see Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

314
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:38,909
Dent, he's just the beginning.

315
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:44,949
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

316
00:24:44,997 --> 00:24:49,889
The Batman has no jurisdiction.
He'll find him and make him squeal.

317
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:53,015
I know the squealers when I see them.

318
00:24:55,829 --> 00:25:00,289
- What do you propose?
- It's simple. We kill the Batman.

319
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:04,113
If it is so simple why
haven't you done it already?

320
00:25:04,351 --> 00:25:06,865
If you are good thing at something,
never do it for free.

321
00:25:07,397 --> 00:25:08,819
How much you want?

322
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,855
Hm... Half.

323
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:18,393
- Are you crazy!
- No I'm not... No, I'm not.

324
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:28,162
If we don't deal with this now,
soon little the Gamble here

325
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:31,115
won't be able to get a
nickel for his grandma.

326
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:33,566
Enough from the clown!

327
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:38,598
Let's not blow this out of proportion.

328
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:41,552
Do you think you can
steal from us and just walk away?

329
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:45,712
- Yeah.
- I'm putting a word out: 500 grand
for this clown dead.

330
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,072
A million alive, so I can
teach him some manners first.

331
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:53,455
Alright, so listen.
Why don't you give me a call when

332
00:25:53,503 --> 00:25:59,260
you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously? Here's my card.

333
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:22,310
You're a hard man to reach.

334
00:26:24,006 --> 00:26:26,054
Lau is halfway to Hong Kong.

335
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,567
If he had asked,
I could have taken his passport.

336
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:31,063
I told you to keep me in the loop.

337
00:26:31,138 --> 00:26:34,824
All that was left in the vaults were
marked bills. They knew we were coming.

338
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:36,794
As soon as your office got involved...

339
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:37,877
My office?

340
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:41,163
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking?

341
00:26:42,086 --> 00:26:45,408
Oh yeah Gordon, I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beef.

342
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:48,926
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

343
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:53,961
We need Lau back.

344
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:57,938
But the Chinese won't extradite
a National under any circumstances.

345
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:02,175
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

346
00:27:02,226 --> 00:27:03,614
I'll get him to sing.

347
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:05,357
We're going after the mob's life savings.

348
00:27:06,366 --> 00:27:07,719
Things will get ugly...

349
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:10,257
I knew the risk
when I took this job, lieutenant.

350
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:11,716
How will you get him back...

351
00:27:14,554 --> 00:27:15,873
He does that.

352
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:19,629
Our Chinese friends left town before I
could tell them the deal was off.

353
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,635
Well I'm sure you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

354
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:24,817
What's wrong with a phone call?

355
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:29,199
I think Mr Lau
deserves a more... personal touch.

356
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:35,383
Now for high altitude jumps, you're
gonna need oxygen and stabilizers.

357
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,500
But what about getting back into the plane?

358
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:46,690
I'd recommend a good travel agent.

359
00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:48,066
Without it landing.

360
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:52,198
Now that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

361
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:58,856
The CIA had a program back in the 60's for getting
their people out of hot spots called skyhook

362
00:27:59,456 --> 00:28:03,779
You could look into that.
Okay, now.

363
00:28:05,136 --> 00:28:08,128
Hardened Kevlar plates over
titanium-tipped

364
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:10,595
triweaved fibers for flexibility.

365
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:13,920
You'll be lighter,
faster, more agile.

366
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,643
Perhaps you should read the instructions first.

367
00:28:20,172 --> 00:28:21,218
Now there is a tradeoff.

368
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:25,118
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

369
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:27,471
We wouldn't want to make
things too easy now, would we?

370
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:30,333
How will it hold up against dogs?

371
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:33,033
We talking Rotweilers or Chiuauas?

372
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:35,839
It should do fine against cats.

373
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:38,414
I found one in Arizona.

374
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:42,966
An very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week and he'd take the cash.

375
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,349
What about a flight crew?

376
00:28:44,377 --> 00:28:48,802
South Korean smugglers; they run flights
into Pyongyang below radar the whole way.

377
00:28:48,842 --> 00:28:49,831
Did you think of an alibi?

378
00:28:50,017 --> 00:28:51,166
Oh, yes.

379
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:04,184
Presentation cancelled

380
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:12,547
I believe this is your plane, sir!

381
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:19,833
You look tired, Alfred.
Will you be all right without me?

382
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:25,296
If you can tell me the Russian for:
Apply your own bloody suntan lotion.

383
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:40,746
Yo Gamble, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

384
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:42,812
And they brought the body.

385
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,319
Dead, that's 500...

386
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:05,023
How about alive?

387
00:30:08,554 --> 00:30:10,943
You want to know how I
got these scars?

388
00:30:13,176 --> 00:30:19,263
My father was a drinker and a fiend.

389
00:30:20,374 --> 00:30:24,367
One night he goes off
crazier than usual

390
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,405
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

391
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:32,312
He does not like that.
Not one bit.

392
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:40,076
So, me watching, he takes the
knife to her, laughing while he does it.

393
00:30:40,748 --> 00:30:46,539
He turns to me and he says:
Why so serious, son?

394
00:30:47,856 --> 00:30:50,279
He comes at me with the knife...

395
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:56,760
Why so serious, son? He sticks
the blade in my mouth:

396
00:30:57,528 --> 00:31:01,009
Let's put a smile on that face!

397
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,639
Why so serious?

398
00:31:13,662 --> 00:31:23,526
Now, our operation is small but there is a
lot of potential for aggressive expansion.

399
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,294
So, which of you fine gentleman
would like to join ourteam?

400
00:31:28,142 --> 00:31:29,894
There's only one spot open right now.

401
00:31:29,977 --> 00:31:34,061
So we're going to
have tryouts?

402
00:31:38,786 --> 00:31:40,333
Make it fast.

403
00:31:50,587 --> 00:31:51,975
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

404
00:31:51,991 --> 00:31:54,642
Mr Lau regrets he isn't able
to greet you in person today.

405
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,251
I understand.

406
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,796
For security purposes, I'm going to
have to ask you to check in your mobile.

407
00:32:10,449 --> 00:32:11,837
Of course.

408
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:17,835
I must apologize for leaving
Gotham in the middle of our negotiations.

409
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,726
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force.

410
00:32:22,131 --> 00:32:24,383
I couldn't let such a thing
threaten my company.

411
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,114
Of course.

412
00:32:25,137 --> 00:32:27,389
A businessman of your stature
will understand

413
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:31,412
that with you here now,
we can continue.

414
00:32:32,595 --> 00:32:36,315
Well I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style Mr Lau...

415
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:41,920
- We do not allow cell phones in here.
- Oh sorry, forgot I had it.

416
00:32:42,347 --> 00:32:47,398
I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

417
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:54,255
We can't afford to be seen to do business
with... whatever it is you're accused of being.

418
00:32:54,302 --> 00:32:56,850
I'm sure a businessman of
your stature will understand.

419
00:32:57,114 --> 00:33:00,868
I think Mr Fox, a
simple phone call might have sufficed.

420
00:33:01,077 --> 00:33:02,396
Mr. Wayne didn't want
you to think that

421
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:04,403
he was deliberately
wasting your time.

422
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:06,355
Just accidentally wasting it.

423
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:11,093
That's very good Mr Lau.
Accidentally, very good.

424
00:33:11,885 --> 00:33:12,749
Hey, sir!

425
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,213
A better view from the train.

426
00:33:33,454 --> 00:33:39,404
- How's the view from LSI hallways?
- Restricted. Lau has held up the networking tight.

427
00:33:39,525 --> 00:33:41,675
- What is this?
- I had RND work it up.

428
00:33:41,706 --> 00:33:44,960
It sends out a high frequency pulse
records in response time.

429
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:46,254
For mapping an environment.

430
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:51,834
- Sonar, just like a...
- a submarine, Mr. Wayne.

431
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:54,167
- And the other device?
- It's in place.

432
00:33:55,036 --> 00:33:58,221
Mr Wayne, good luck.

433
00:35:37,491 --> 00:35:38,776
Where are the police?

434
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:39,769
They are coming.

435
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,692
Then what the hell
am I paying them for?

436
00:37:42,645 --> 00:37:44,124
Please deliver to Lieutenant Gordon.

437
00:37:48,405 --> 00:37:51,829
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

438
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,895
The money is the only reason
I am still alive.

439
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,475
Oh, you mean when they find out
that you've helped us they're going to kill you?

440
00:37:59,517 --> 00:38:01,030
Are you threatening my client?

441
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:04,825
No, I'm just assuming your
client's cooperation with this investigation.

442
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,735
As well everyone.

443
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:13,112
No?
Okay.

444
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:16,598
Enjoy your time in county Mr Lau.

445
00:38:17,317 --> 00:38:20,571
Wait.
I won't give you the money.

446
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:24,260
But I will give you my clients.
All of them.

447
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:30,797
You were a glorified accountant. What could you
possibly have on all of them that we could charge?

448
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:34,630
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all the investments.

449
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:36,172
One big pot.

450
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:40,820
- Got it.
- One minute.

451
00:38:42,477 --> 00:38:47,096
If they pull their money we can
charge them all as one crew on conspiracy.

452
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:48,132
Charge them with what?

453
00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:51,855
In a Reiko case, if you can charge one
of the conspirators with a felony, you can...

454
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:53,678
Charge all of them with it. That's great.

455
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,380
Mr Lau. What kind of details do you
have about this communal fund?

456
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:03,278
Edgers, notebooks...

457
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:05,977
Immunity, protection and a
chartered plane back to Hong Kong.

458
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:07,676
After you testify in open court.

459
00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:10,915
And I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up,

460
00:39:10,986 --> 00:39:12,465
what's going to happen with all that money?

461
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:16,251
Like I said, I am
good with calculation.

462
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:21,042
He can't go to county,
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

463
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:22,828
What is this Gordon, your fortress?

464
00:39:23,772 --> 00:39:28,357
- Do you trust them over at county?
- I don't trust them here.

465
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:31,695
Lau stays.

466
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:36,481
Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.

467
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:39,678
He would, we should
have hired the clown.

468
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:54,741
I'm not aware of any participation
by the Batman in the investigations.

469
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:56,794
Our boy looks good on the tube

470
00:39:56,825 --> 00:39:59,646
You sure you want to embarrass me
in front of my friends lieutenant?

471
00:39:59,662 --> 00:40:02,551
No, don't worry.
They're coming too.

472
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,341
Have a nice trip. See you in the next fall.

473
00:40:12,691 --> 00:40:16,809
712 counts of extortion,
849 counts of racketeering,

474
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:22,072
246 counts of fraud,
87 counts of conspiracy, murder...

475
00:40:23,398 --> 00:40:28,324
527 counts of obstruction ofjustice.
How do the defendants plead?

476
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,528
Order in court.

477
00:40:36,555 --> 00:40:41,640
549 criminals at once. How did you
convince Surrillo to hearthis farce?

478
00:40:41,674 --> 00:40:46,190
She shares my enthusiasm
for justice. After all she is a Judge.

479
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:49,306
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convinctions out of Surrillo,

480
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:52,170
you're going to set a new record
in appeals for quickest tick in the ass.

481
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:56,556
It won't matter, the head guys make bail,
sure. But the midlevel guys, they can't.

482
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,987
They can't afford to be off
the streets long enough for trial and appeal,

483
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,567
they'll cut deals that include some jail time.

484
00:41:01,702 --> 00:41:04,591
Think of all you can do
with 18 months of clean streets.

485
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:07,408
Mr. Mayor, you can't...

486
00:41:07,442 --> 00:41:09,194
Get out, both of you.

487
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:14,547
Sit down.

488
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:23,196
The public likes you.
That's the only reason that this might fly.

489
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,407
But that means it's on you. They are all going
to come after you now and not just the mob.

490
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:34,027
Politicians, journalists, cops. Anyone
whose wallet is about to get lighter.

491
00:41:34,664 --> 00:41:39,124
Are you up to it? You better be,
because if they get anything on you

492
00:41:39,158 --> 00:41:44,175
and those criminals are back on the streets...
Followed swiftly by you and me.

493
00:42:06,498 --> 00:42:08,978
I think your fundraiser will
be a great success sir.

494
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,375
And why do you think I want to
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

495
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,756
Well, I assumed it was your
usual reason for socializing

496
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:17,095
beyond myself and the scum
of Gotham's underbelly.

497
00:42:17,112 --> 00:42:18,966
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

498
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:24,161
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually it's Dent.

499
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:26,263
The police disclosed the footage
found at scene of the body.

500
00:42:26,297 --> 00:42:29,152
Sensitive viewers please be aware:
The image is disturbing.

501
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:32,530
- Tell them your name.
- Brian.

502
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:40,269
- Are you the real Batman?
- No! No!

503
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,926
Then why do you dress up like him?

504
00:42:47,685 --> 00:42:52,770
- He's a symbol... that we don't have to be afraid of
scum like you!
- Yeah, you do, Brian. You really do!

505
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,216
So you think Batman has
made Gotham a better place?

506
00:43:09,277 --> 00:43:12,667
You see this is how crazy
Batman has made Gotham.

507
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:19,397
If you want to order in Gotham the Batman
must take off his mask and turn himself in!

508
00:43:20,187 --> 00:43:23,475
And every day he doesn't,
people will die!

509
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:29,645
Starting tonight.
I'm a man of my word.

510
00:43:46,397 --> 00:43:52,825
Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld,
scared stiff by the trust fund brigade.

511
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,228
- I'll be back.
- Rachel!

512
00:43:54,243 --> 00:43:56,291
A little liquid courage,
Mr Dent?

513
00:43:58,023 --> 00:43:59,911
- Alfred, right?
- That's right, sir.

514
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,047
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her for her whole life?

515
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:04,163
Not yet, sir.

516
00:44:06,887 --> 00:44:09,208
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

517
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,036
Oh, you have no idea!

518
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:34,173
I'm sorry that I'm late, but I'm glad
to see that you all got started without me.

519
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:40,647
Now, where is Harvey?
Where is Harvey Dent, the man of the hour!

520
00:44:40,672 --> 00:44:44,824
And where's Rachel Dawes,
she is my oldest friend. Come here.

521
00:44:44,842 --> 00:44:48,926
When Rachel first told me that she was
dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say:

522
00:44:48,966 --> 00:44:53,426
"The guy that was cut off from those awful campaign
commercials, I believe in Harvey Dent?"

523
00:44:53,446 --> 00:44:57,735
Yeah nice slogan, Harvey.
But you caught Rachel's attention.

524
00:44:57,754 --> 00:45:04,546
Then I started to pay attention to Harvey
and all that he's been doing as our new DA.

525
00:45:04,573 --> 00:45:09,897
And you know what?
I believe in Harvey Dent.

526
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,573
I believe that on his watch
Gotham can feel a little safer.

527
00:45:15,586 --> 00:45:18,009
A little more optimistic.

528
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:23,309
Look at this face.
This is the face of Gotham's bright future.

529
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:25,988
To Harvey Dent.
Let's hear it for him.

530
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:40,433
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand when you are making fun of him.

531
00:45:40,461 --> 00:45:41,257
But I do.

532
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:42,642
No, I meant every word.

533
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:49,122
You know that day that you once told me about
when Gotham would no longer need Batman?

534
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,561
- It's coming.
- Bruce...

535
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,338
- You can't ask me to wait for that.
- It's happening now.

536
00:45:55,368 --> 00:45:57,120
Harvey is that hero.

537
00:45:57,169 --> 00:46:01,720
He locked up half of the city's criminals
and he did it without wearing a mask.

538
00:46:02,123 --> 00:46:04,842
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

539
00:46:05,544 --> 00:46:10,231
You throw a party Wayne, I'll give you that.
Thanks again.

540
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,308
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

541
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:20,414
Lieutenant, that Joker card
pinned to the body?

542
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:22,403
Forensics found 3 sets of DNA.

543
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,876
- Any matches?
- All three.

544
00:46:23,904 --> 00:46:27,294
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Loeb.

545
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,710
The Joker is telling us
who he's targeting.

546
00:46:29,724 --> 00:46:32,579
Get a unit overto Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

547
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:34,920
Get them both into protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

548
00:46:34,951 --> 00:46:35,576
City Hall.

549
00:46:35,805 --> 00:46:38,194
Seal the building.
No one in or out until I get there.

550
00:46:38,224 --> 00:46:38,815
Got it.

551
00:46:51,086 --> 00:46:54,271
- Gordon! What are you up to?
- We're secure.

552
00:46:54,306 --> 00:46:56,763
I want a floor by floor
search of the entire building.

553
00:46:56,807 --> 00:46:59,321
Sorry sir, we believe the Joker
has made a threat against your life.

554
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:01,057
These are dangerous people, Judge.

555
00:47:01,074 --> 00:47:03,156
Yes, but you're not
giving me an awful lot of information.

556
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:05,847
- Even we don't know where you're going.
- Take the envelope.

557
00:47:05,894 --> 00:47:08,283
Get in, open it. It'll tell
you where you're headed.

558
00:47:12,377 --> 00:47:14,197
You can not leave me alone
with these people.

559
00:47:14,275 --> 00:47:17,426
The whole mob is after you
and you're worried about these guys?

560
00:47:17,447 --> 00:47:19,495
Compared to this,
the mob doesn't scare me.

561
00:47:19,738 --> 00:47:22,957
Gordon, you're unlikely
to discover this for yourself, so...

562
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:27,757
Take my word, the Police Commissioner
there's a lot of threats.

563
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:32,773
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

564
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,701
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

565
00:47:35,731 --> 00:47:36,777
Yeah, I bet.

566
00:47:36,808 --> 00:47:41,063
Yeah, it makes you think
about things you couldn't stand losing.

567
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,922
About who you want to
spend the rest of your life with.

568
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,229
It's a pretty big commitment.

569
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:46,812
Well, not if the Mob has their way.

570
00:47:52,098 --> 00:47:57,286
It'd be good to explain to my wife
why I'm late for dinner tonight.

571
00:47:57,304 --> 00:48:00,091
Sir, the Joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

572
00:48:02,068 --> 00:48:06,755
- Don't do that.
- Alright. Let's be serious then.

573
00:48:07,348 --> 00:48:10,033
- Okay.
- What's your answer?

574
00:48:15,763 --> 00:48:18,049
I don't have an answer.

575
00:48:19,484 --> 00:48:20,837
How'd they get my DNA?

576
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,690
Somebody with access to your
office or your house

577
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,892
must have lifted a tissue
or a glass...

578
00:48:24,964 --> 00:48:25,726
Wait!

579
00:48:26,094 --> 00:48:28,278
- I guess the answer is no.
- Harvey...

580
00:48:28,787 --> 00:48:30,732
- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey!

581
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,608
Just tell me it's not Wayne,
the guy's a complete...

582
00:48:34,772 --> 00:48:36,490
What are you doing?

583
00:48:54,709 --> 00:48:56,427
Get a medic!

584
00:49:02,448 --> 00:49:03,528
We made it!

585
00:49:09,473 --> 00:49:12,761
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

586
00:49:15,568 --> 00:49:18,719
We are tonight's entertainment!

587
00:49:20,442 --> 00:49:21,898
I only have one question.

588
00:49:22,885 --> 00:49:25,604
Where is Harvey Dent?

589
00:49:35,888 --> 00:49:38,174
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

590
00:49:38,213 --> 00:49:39,794
Hands up, pretty boy!

591
00:49:46,385 --> 00:49:48,034
Do you know where I can find Harvey?

592
00:49:48,058 --> 00:49:50,743
I need to talk to him about something,
something little.

593
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:52,334
No...

594
00:49:54,298 --> 00:49:56,755
- What's going on out there?
- Wayne!

595
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:01,193
Ah, thank God you've
got a panic room. Wait!

596
00:50:02,058 --> 00:50:03,741
You got to be kidding me.

597
00:50:04,115 --> 00:50:09,269
- You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.
- We're not intimidated by thugs!

598
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:16,239
You know, you remind me of my father.

599
00:50:17,573 --> 00:50:21,122
- I hated my father!
- Okay stop!

600
00:50:25,486 --> 00:50:32,915
Well, hello beautiful!
You must be Harvey's squeeze!

601
00:50:34,673 --> 00:50:36,561
And you are beautiful.

602
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:47,114
You look nervous.
Is it the scars?

603
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,497
You want to know how I got them?

604
00:50:51,957 --> 00:50:54,141
Come here.
Hey!

605
00:50:55,027 --> 00:50:56,506
Look at me.

606
00:50:57,293 --> 00:51:01,241
So I had a wife, beautiful, like you,

607
00:51:02,218 --> 00:51:09,078
who tells me I worry too much.
Who tells me I ought to smile more.

608
00:51:09,662 --> 00:51:14,486
Who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks

609
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:20,314
One day, they carve her face.
And we have no money for surgeries.

610
00:51:20,346 --> 00:51:25,272
She can't take it.
I just want to see her smile again, hmm?

611
00:51:26,786 --> 00:51:29,778
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

612
00:51:30,112 --> 00:51:37,871
So... I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this... to myself

613
00:51:38,279 --> 00:51:45,230
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me! She leaves.

614
00:51:45,698 --> 00:51:51,091
Now I see the funny side.
Now I'm always smiling!

615
00:51:54,187 --> 00:51:57,645
A little fight in you.
I like that.

616
00:51:57,662 --> 00:51:58,913
Then you're going to love me.

617
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:30,481
- Drop the gun.
- Oh, sure!

618
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:33,845
You just take off your little
mask and show us all who you really are.

619
00:52:39,966 --> 00:52:43,959
- Let her go.
- Very poor choice of words!

620
00:53:05,748 --> 00:53:07,295
Are you alright?

621
00:53:10,223 --> 00:53:11,736
Let's not do that again...

622
00:53:12,905 --> 00:53:14,953
- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.

623
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:17,643
Thank you.

624
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:19,497
Jim, it's over!

625
00:53:19,672 --> 00:53:22,425
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

626
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:23,992
But the prosecution is over!

627
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:28,535
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge while judges
and police commissioners are getting blown away.

628
00:53:29,033 --> 00:53:30,045
What about Dent?

629
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:31,888
If he's got any sense,
Dent's halfway to Mexico.

630
00:53:32,524 --> 00:53:33,980
So where do you keep your trash?

631
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,358
You're due at court.

632
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:38,828
I need you alive long enough
to get you under record.

633
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:42,205
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

634
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:45,231
If you refuse to cooperate you're
not coming back here, you go to county.

635
00:53:45,651 --> 00:53:47,869
How long you calculate
you'll last in there?

636
00:53:49,681 --> 00:53:51,694
Targeting me won't get
their money back.

637
00:53:51,748 --> 00:53:54,637
I knew the mob wouldn't go down
without a fight, but this is different.

638
00:53:54,672 --> 00:53:56,958
- They've crossed the line.
- You've crossed the line first, sir.

639
00:53:56,994 --> 00:54:00,316
You squeezed them, you hammered
them to the point of desperation.

640
00:54:01,013 --> 00:54:05,131
In their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

641
00:54:06,915 --> 00:54:08,667
Criminals aren't complicated Alfred.

642
00:54:09,342 --> 00:54:11,424
We just need to figure out what he's after.

643
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:16,237
With respect, master Wayne, perhaps this
is a man you don't fully understand either.

644
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:20,084
A long time ago I was in Burma.

645
00:54:20,108 --> 00:54:23,362
My friends and I were working
for the local government.

646
00:54:23,528 --> 00:54:26,042
They were trying to buy the
loyalty of tribal leaders by

647
00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:28,583
bribing them with precious stones.

648
00:54:29,118 --> 00:54:33,737
But their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Yangoon by a bandit.

649
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:36,156
So, we went looking forthe stones.

650
00:54:37,492 --> 00:54:42,885
But in 6 months we never met
anyone who traded with him.

651
00:54:43,293 --> 00:54:49,846
One day, I saw a child playing with
a ruby the size of a tangerine.

652
00:54:50,781 --> 00:54:55,798
- The bandit had been throwing them away.
- So why steal them?

653
00:54:55,823 --> 00:54:57,836
Well, because he thought
it was good sport.

654
00:54:57,872 --> 00:55:02,229
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

655
00:55:02,635 --> 00:55:07,390
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned, or negotiated with.

656
00:55:07,406 --> 00:55:11,160
Some men just want
to watch the world burn.

657
00:55:49,184 --> 00:55:50,697
Get the names.

658
00:55:57,078 --> 00:56:02,402
- Richard Dent.
- Patrick Harvey.

659
00:56:02,751 --> 00:56:03,683
Harvey Dent.

660
00:56:03,887 --> 00:56:06,742
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

661
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:09,218
Us contaminate it? It's because
of you these guys are dead...

662
00:56:09,234 --> 00:56:10,223
Detective!

663
00:56:12,678 --> 00:56:14,794
Just a minute guys.

664
00:56:16,391 --> 00:56:18,109
It's brick underneath.

665
00:56:18,492 --> 00:56:20,210
You going to take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

666
00:56:20,257 --> 00:56:24,978
No.
Fingerprints.

667
00:56:31,644 --> 00:56:33,293
Obituaries.
Mayor Anthony Garcia.

668
00:56:33,344 --> 00:56:35,494
Whatever you're going to do,
do it fast.

669
00:56:37,463 --> 00:56:42,048
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

670
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:01,458
I'm not sure you
made it loud enough, sir.

671
00:57:14,688 --> 00:57:16,041
What can I do for you Mr Reese?

672
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,587
You wanted me to do the
diligence on the LSI holdings deal again.

673
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:26,194
- Well, I found some irregularities.
- Our CEO is in police custody.

674
00:57:26,222 --> 00:57:29,077
No, not with their numbers
With yours.

675
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:30,524
Applied sciences.

676
00:57:30,558 --> 00:57:34,608
A whole division of Wayne
Enterprises just disappeared, overnight.

677
00:57:34,646 --> 00:57:38,195
I went down to the archives and
I started pulling some old files.

678
00:57:39,735 --> 00:57:41,623
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby out there

679
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,351
pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

680
00:57:45,774 --> 00:57:49,790
Now you got the entire RND
department burning through cash

681
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,560
claiming it's related
to cellphones for the army?

682
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:56,201
What are you building for
him now, a rocket ship?

683
00:57:58,089 --> 00:58:03,573
I want 10 million dollars
a year for the rest of my life.

684
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,207
Let me get this straight.

685
00:58:09,912 --> 00:58:15,737
You think that your client, one of the
wealthiest, most powerful men in the world

686
00:58:15,756 --> 00:58:20,272
is secretly a vigilante, who spends his
nights beating criminals to a pulp...

687
00:58:20,293 --> 00:58:25,651
...with his bare hands.
And your plan is to blackmail this person?

688
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,118
Good luck.

689
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,880
Keep that.

690
00:58:48,073 --> 00:58:49,961
This is your original scan.

691
00:58:51,845 --> 00:58:53,665
Here it is re-engineered.

692
00:59:02,435 --> 00:59:05,154
And there's the thumbprint he left when
he pushed the round in the clip.

693
00:59:07,641 --> 00:59:09,097
I'll get you a copy.

694
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:13,669
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign RND?

695
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:15,697
Yes, government
telecommunications project.

696
00:59:15,721 --> 00:59:17,803
I wasn't aware we had any
government contracts.

697
00:59:18,114 --> 00:59:21,163
Lucius, I'm playing
this one pretty close to the chest.

698
00:59:22,209 --> 00:59:23,688
Fair enough.

699
00:59:27,228 --> 00:59:30,379
With no word from the Batman.
Even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb.

700
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:33,465
These cops have to be wondering
if the Joker will make good on

701
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:36,675
his threat in the obituary column of
the Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

702
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:42,933
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

703
00:59:42,961 --> 00:59:49,013
Cross reference the addresses. Look
for Park Side, overlooking the parade.

704
00:59:50,682 --> 00:59:55,938
I got one! Melvin White,
1502 Randalf Apartments

705
00:59:56,144 --> 00:59:59,796
Aggravated his soul,
moved to Arkham twice.

706
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:40,311
How many you got on the roof?

707
01:00:40,815 --> 01:00:43,670
We're tight but frankly
there's a lot of windows up here!

708
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:56,241
Commissioner Loeb
dedicated his life to

709
01:00:56,267 --> 01:00:59,213
law enforcement and to
the protection of his community.

710
01:00:59,488 --> 01:01:01,206
I remember when I first took office,

711
01:01:01,248 --> 01:01:03,569
I asked him if
he wanted to stay on as Commissioner and...

712
01:01:12,971 --> 01:01:16,327
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words nor should he have been

713
01:01:17,744 --> 01:01:21,635
A number of policies that
he enacted were unpopular.

714
01:01:21,657 --> 01:01:24,740
Policies that flooded
my office with angry calls and letter...

715
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:30,816
- Who is it?
- What happened?

716
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:35,870
They took our guns and uniforms.

717
01:01:44,973 --> 01:01:49,057
We must rememberthat vigilance
is the price of safety.

718
01:01:49,415 --> 01:01:52,600
Standby, Honor, Guard, Atten-hut.

719
01:01:56,501 --> 01:01:57,980
Ready

720
01:01:58,025 --> 01:01:59,071
Aim

721
01:01:59,703 --> 01:02:01,159
Fire!

722
01:02:02,205 --> 01:02:04,924
Ready, aim...

723
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,875
Ready, aim...

724
01:02:21,357 --> 01:02:22,608
Get him out!

725
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:33,682
- I'll see you later!
- Why are you coming back?

726
01:02:46,351 --> 01:02:47,534
Get out!

727
01:02:52,036 --> 01:02:54,254
Tell me what you
know about the Joker.

728
01:03:24,876 --> 01:03:28,164
- No!
- I'm sorry Barbara.

729
01:03:28,587 --> 01:03:31,579
Junior, go play with
your sister, go ahead.

730
01:03:32,556 --> 01:03:36,606
If there is anything that
I can do, we're here foryou.

731
01:03:40,645 --> 01:03:47,733
Are you happy... Are you
You brought this craziness on us... You did!

732
01:03:50,643 --> 01:03:54,693
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't want to talk to us.

733
01:03:55,824 --> 01:03:58,475
May God help whoever
he does want to talk to.

734
01:03:59,608 --> 01:04:02,429
Can we go some place quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

735
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:05,726
Why makes you think
I want to hear you talk?

736
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:06,824
What?

737
01:04:39,828 --> 01:04:42,183
- Harvey, where are you?
- Where are you?

738
01:04:42,198 --> 01:04:45,713
I'm where you should be at MCU
I'm trying to deal with all this mess.

739
01:04:45,738 --> 01:04:46,921
Can I get the fingerprint analysis?

740
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:49,727
Rachel, listen to me.
You're not safe there.

741
01:04:49,773 --> 01:04:51,991
- Oh, this is Gordors unit.
- Gordors gone, Rachel.

742
01:04:52,029 --> 01:04:54,714
- He vouched for these men.
- And he's gone.

743
01:04:59,923 --> 01:05:02,209
The Joker has named you next.

744
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:05,214
Is there anyone in this
town we can trust?

745
01:05:05,477 --> 01:05:08,662
Bruce.
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

746
01:05:08,708 --> 01:05:10,699
No Rachel, I know
you're his friend but...

747
01:05:10,717 --> 01:05:11,706
Harvey, Trust me.

748
01:05:12,536 --> 01:05:15,585
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

749
01:05:15,636 --> 01:05:19,322
Then you go straight there. Don't tell
anybody where you're going. I'll find you there.

750
01:05:19,356 --> 01:05:20,539
I love you.

751
01:05:34,863 --> 01:05:36,285
I want the Joker.

752
01:05:37,495 --> 01:05:41,886
From one professional to another, if you're
trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot.

753
01:05:41,929 --> 01:05:44,511
From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me.

754
01:05:44,535 --> 01:05:45,650
I'm counting on it.

755
01:05:53,664 --> 01:05:54,562
Where is he?

756
01:05:54,581 --> 01:05:56,833
I don't know where he is.
He found us.

757
01:05:56,882 --> 01:06:00,807
- He must have friends.
- Friends? Have you met this guy?

758
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:05,078
- Someone knows where he is!
- Nobody's going to tell you nothing.

759
01:06:05,096 --> 01:06:09,317
He was right.
You got rules. The Joker...

760
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:13,181
He's got no rules.
Nobody's going to cross him foryou.

761
01:06:13,226 --> 01:06:17,549
If you want this guy, you got one way.
But you already know what that is.

762
01:06:17,585 --> 01:06:21,100
Just take off that mask
let him come find you.

763
01:06:22,584 --> 01:06:26,236
Or are you going to let a couple more
people get killed while you make up your mind.

764
01:06:27,972 --> 01:06:29,553
You want to play games?

765
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:37,830
How's that feel?

766
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:39,792
- Don't kill...
- I wouldn't?

767
01:06:41,837 --> 01:06:44,761
You don't think I will?
You don't think I will?

768
01:06:46,828 --> 01:06:49,615
No, I wouldn't.

769
01:06:51,169 --> 01:06:53,217
That's why I'm not going
to leave it up to me.

770
01:06:54,824 --> 01:07:02,014
Heads, you get to keep your head.
Tails, not so lucky.

771
01:07:02,054 --> 01:07:04,807
So, you want to tell me about the Joker?

772
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:18,783
- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything, I don't!

773
01:07:19,141 --> 01:07:23,623
You're not playing the odds, friend.
Let's do it again.

774
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:31,056
- You'd leave a mars life to chance?
- Not exactly.

775
01:07:31,077 --> 01:07:33,329
His name is Shif, Thomas.

776
01:07:33,348 --> 01:07:37,296
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

777
01:07:37,326 --> 01:07:39,009
The kind of mind
that Joker attracts.

778
01:07:39,528 --> 01:07:41,450
What do you expect to learn from him?

779
01:07:45,385 --> 01:07:48,240
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's going to kill Rachel!

780
01:07:48,275 --> 01:07:50,926
You are the symbol of hope
I could never be.

781
01:07:51,172 --> 01:07:53,823
Your stand against organized
crime is the first

782
01:07:53,851 --> 01:07:56,570
legitimate ray of light in
Gotham in decades.

783
01:07:56,634 --> 01:07:59,626
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

784
01:08:00,523 --> 01:08:02,605
All the criminals you pulled off
the streets would be released

785
01:08:02,626 --> 01:08:05,049
and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.

786
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:09,694
- You're going to hold a press
conference tomorrow morning.
- Why?

787
01:08:09,723 --> 01:08:13,113
No one else will die because of me.
Gotham is in your hands now.

788
01:08:13,954 --> 01:08:17,378
You can't.
You can't give in.

789
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:18,406
You can't give in!

790
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:39,596
Harvey called.
He said Batman's going to turn himself in.

791
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,048
I have no choice.

792
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:44,632
Do you honestly think that's going to
keep the Joker from killing people?

793
01:08:44,676 --> 01:08:47,361
Maybe not, but I have
enough blood on my hands.

794
01:08:48,495 --> 01:08:53,046
I have seen now what I would have to
become to stop a man like him.

795
01:08:54,001 --> 01:08:56,617
You once told me that if
the day came when I...

796
01:08:56,639 --> 01:08:58,493
was finished, then we would be together.

797
01:09:00,215 --> 01:09:03,230
Bruce, don't make me your
one hope for a normal life.

798
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,112
Did you mean it?

799
01:09:07,705 --> 01:09:08,956
Yes.

800
01:09:29,158 --> 01:09:33,083
If you turn yourself in, they're
not going to let us be together.

801
01:09:44,576 --> 01:09:47,431
- Logs as well?
- Everything.

802
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,649
People are dying Alfred.
What would you have me do?

803
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:05,051
- Endure... master Wayne.
- Take it... They'll hate you for it.

804
01:10:05,499 --> 01:10:09,356
But that's the point of Batman,
he can be the outcast.

805
01:10:09,397 --> 01:10:14,585
He can make the choice that
no one else can make, the right choice.

806
01:10:15,012 --> 01:10:19,494
Well today I found out what Batman can't do.
He can't endure this.

807
01:10:19,517 --> 01:10:22,099
Today you get to say
"I told you so."

808
01:10:23,222 --> 01:10:25,975
Today, I don't want to.

809
01:10:32,335 --> 01:10:34,087
But I did bloody tell you.

810
01:10:36,838 --> 01:10:41,923
I suppose they'll lock me up as well.
As your accomplice...

811
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:45,657
Accomplice? I'm going to tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

812
01:10:51,004 --> 01:10:52,426
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Thank you for coming.

813
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,676
I've called this
press conference for two reasons.

814
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:57,140
Firstly, to assure
the citizens of Gotham that

815
01:10:57,181 --> 01:11:00,662
everything that can be done over
the Joker killings is being done.

816
01:11:01,568 --> 01:11:04,355
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

817
01:11:05,072 --> 01:11:06,687
But first, let's consider the situation.

818
01:11:06,727 --> 01:11:08,945
Should we give into
this terrorist's demands?

819
01:11:09,994 --> 01:11:12,940
- Do we really think that...
- Would you rather protect an outlaw vigilante

820
01:11:12,982 --> 01:11:14,995
...than the lives of citizens?

821
01:11:15,033 --> 01:11:16,512
The Batman is an outlaw.

822
01:11:18,439 --> 01:11:20,327
But that's not why
we're demanding he turn himself in.

823
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:21,824
We're doing it because we're scared.

824
01:11:22,053 --> 01:11:24,840
We've been happy to let the Batman
clean up our streets for us until now.

825
01:11:24,856 --> 01:11:26,938
Things are worse than ever!

826
01:11:29,441 --> 01:11:30,726
Yes they are...

827
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:36,337
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

828
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:43,528
And I promise you...
the dawn is coming.

829
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:46,854
One day, the Batman will have to
answer for the laws he's broken.

830
01:11:46,873 --> 01:11:49,797
But to us, not to this madman!

831
01:11:50,448 --> 01:11:51,961
No more dead cops!

832
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:57,992
He should turn himself in!

833
01:12:03,809 --> 01:12:06,027
So be it.
Take the Batman into custody.

834
01:12:09,345 --> 01:12:10,528
I am the Batman.

835
01:12:21,429 --> 01:12:22,680
Alfred!

836
01:12:24,502 --> 01:12:26,720
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

837
01:12:26,808 --> 01:12:29,527
- He went down to the press conference.
- I know, and he just stoodby!

838
01:12:29,614 --> 01:12:32,902
Perhaps both Bruce and
Mr. Dent believe the Batman

839
01:12:32,954 --> 01:12:36,742
stands for something more important than
the whims of a terrorist, Ms. Dawes.

840
01:12:37,497 --> 01:12:39,488
Even if everyone hates him for it.

841
01:12:39,936 --> 01:12:41,881
That's a sacrifice he's making.

842
01:12:42,342 --> 01:12:46,062
He's not being a hero.
He is being something more.

843
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:50,940
Yeah, you're absolutely right. Letting Harvey
take the fall for this is not heroic at all.

844
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:57,191
- You know him better than anyone.
- I do.

845
01:12:59,912 --> 01:13:03,860
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right.

846
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:07,711
- How will I know?
- It's not sealed.

847
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:10,655
- Bye Alfred.

848
01:13:14,245 --> 01:13:15,792
- Goodbye Rachel.

849
01:13:24,467 --> 01:13:26,685
Sorry, I didn't have time
to talk this through with you...

850
01:13:26,771 --> 01:13:27,760
What are you doing?

851
01:13:27,874 --> 01:13:29,421
They're transferring me
to Central holding.

852
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:33,160
This is the Joker's chance. And when
he attacks, the Batman will take him down.

853
01:13:33,286 --> 01:13:35,538
Listen to me, this is too dangerous!

854
01:13:35,591 --> 01:13:37,639
We get this guy to county,
he's their problem.

855
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:39,675
The streets will be cleared
along your route. Let's go!

856
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:42,780
Lieutenant, the convoy stops for no reason!

857
01:13:43,509 --> 01:13:44,828
I hope you got some moves pal.

858
01:13:44,844 --> 01:13:47,961
He's using you as bait. He doesn't
even know if he can get the Joker.

859
01:13:47,998 --> 01:13:50,580
- He's failed so far.
- How do you know what he's looking for?

860
01:13:50,601 --> 01:13:51,590
I just, I do!

861
01:13:51,902 --> 01:13:53,620
Anyway Harvey,
this isn't just about you.

862
01:13:53,658 --> 01:13:57,742
What about all the people who are depending on
you to clean the city up and to do it honorably?

863
01:14:04,192 --> 01:14:07,207
Harvey, tell everyone the truth.

864
01:14:07,258 --> 01:14:08,577
Heads, I go through with it.

865
01:14:09,301 --> 01:14:13,226
This is your life! You can't leave
something like that to chance.

866
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:14,716
I'm not.

867
01:14:17,848 --> 01:14:19,964
You make your own luck.

868
01:14:42,859 --> 01:14:44,542
Hey! You wait like
everyone else, pal.

869
01:14:52,462 --> 01:14:56,580
What the hell is that?
Obstruction ahead! Obstruction ahead!

870
01:14:57,317 --> 01:15:01,037
Damn it! All units, divert down onto
lower 5th. I repeat, exit down.

871
01:15:01,071 --> 01:15:04,791
- Exit down!
- Lower 5th? We'll be like
turkeys on Thanksgiving down there.

872
01:15:38,155 --> 01:15:39,668
Come on. Get us out of here.
Let's go.

873
01:15:41,816 --> 01:15:44,068
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

874
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:45,255
We got trouble, guys.

875
01:15:48,547 --> 01:15:49,479
Lock and load!

876
01:16:00,809 --> 01:16:02,060
What the hell was that?

877
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:25,760
These things were
built for that, right?

878
01:16:25,785 --> 01:16:27,798
He's going to need something
a lot bigger to get through this.

879
01:16:30,007 --> 01:16:30,632
What is that?

880
01:16:32,515 --> 01:16:33,766
What is that? A bazooka!

881
01:16:42,471 --> 01:16:43,722
I didn't sign up for this!

882
01:17:00,568 --> 01:17:01,296
Look out.

883
01:17:02,672 --> 01:17:03,195
Down!

884
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:27,539
Come on! Let's go!

885
01:18:14,004 --> 01:18:19,362
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent!
Excuse me, I want to drive.

886
01:18:23,983 --> 01:18:27,339
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

887
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:37,399
We got to get topside.
We need air support now.

888
01:18:42,804 --> 01:18:44,749
I like this job! I like it!

889
01:18:46,841 --> 01:18:49,958
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

890
01:19:03,543 --> 01:19:04,237
Goodbye.

891
01:19:14,304 --> 01:19:16,488
We're on point! Ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

892
01:19:23,746 --> 01:19:25,998
That's what I'm talking about.
Aircabs.

893
01:19:39,879 --> 01:19:43,064
Okay! Rack 'em up, rack 'em up,
rack 'em up!

894
01:20:09,515 --> 01:20:10,413
That's not good.

895
01:20:14,254 --> 01:20:15,403
Okay, That's not good!

896
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,182
Now there is the Batman.

897
01:21:04,785 --> 01:21:06,400
Oh, you want to play!
Come on.

898
01:21:09,269 --> 01:21:09,758
Come on...

899
01:21:19,377 --> 01:21:19,968
He missed!

900
01:21:34,469 --> 01:21:36,414
You can't stop here!
We're like sitting ducks!

901
01:21:58,378 --> 01:22:01,632
Come on... Come on...
I want you to do it.

902
01:22:01,655 --> 01:22:02,644
Come on!

903
01:22:09,531 --> 01:22:11,886
Hit me... hit me!

904
01:22:13,482 --> 01:22:14,380
Hit me!

905
01:22:42,955 --> 01:22:44,673
Could you please just give me a minute?

906
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:48,966
We got you,
you son of a bitch.

907
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:56,925
Gordon... You do like to
play things pretty close to the chest?

908
01:22:56,955 --> 01:22:57,944
We got him, Harvey.

909
01:22:59,048 --> 01:23:01,869
Mr. Dent, Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

910
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:05,864
No. I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

911
01:23:05,901 --> 01:23:08,552
But you and your office have been
working with the Batman all along?

912
01:23:09,101 --> 01:23:13,117
No. But I trusted him to do
the right thing. Saving my ass.

913
01:23:13,147 --> 01:23:15,968
Alright people! That's enough.
Let him be.

914
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:20,745
Thank you, detective. I got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

915
01:23:20,773 --> 01:23:22,058
Thank you, counselor.

916
01:23:38,696 --> 01:23:41,176
Stay away! All of you.

917
01:23:42,436 --> 01:23:45,826
I don't want anything for his mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

918
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:48,937
Back from the dead?

919
01:23:51,463 --> 01:23:54,387
I... I couldn't risk my
family's safety.

920
01:23:55,589 --> 01:23:56,453
What do we got?

921
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:04,866
Nothing. No matches on prints, DNA, dental.
Clothing is custom, no labels.

922
01:24:04,894 --> 01:24:11,584
Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint.
No name, no other alias.

923
01:24:11,597 --> 01:24:16,921
Go home, Gordon. The clown will keep till morning.
Go get some rest. You're going to need it.

924
01:24:17,883 --> 01:24:23,810
Tomorrow you take the big job. You don't have
any say in the matter, Commissioner Gordon.

925
01:24:40,147 --> 01:24:41,830
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk...

926
01:24:49,363 --> 01:24:51,684
- Heads up big bastards!
- I don't feel good...

927
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:52,530
You're a cop killer.

928
01:24:52,559 --> 01:24:54,743
You're lucky to be feeling
anything below the neck.

929
01:24:54,774 --> 01:24:55,763
Police!

930
01:24:55,776 --> 01:24:56,765
Stay away from the bars!

931
01:24:56,778 --> 01:24:57,767
My insides hurt.

932
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,822
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

933
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:20,920
Actually this time I saved him.

934
01:25:33,008 --> 01:25:34,327
Has he said anything yet?

935
01:25:41,752 --> 01:25:45,233
Evening... Commissioner.

936
01:25:53,674 --> 01:25:55,221
Harvey Dent never made it home.

937
01:25:56,218 --> 01:25:56,946
Of course not.

938
01:25:56,981 --> 01:25:58,232
What have you done with him?

939
01:25:59,307 --> 01:26:03,858
Me? I was right here.

940
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:07,483
Who did you leave him with?

941
01:26:08,684 --> 01:26:09,867
Your people?

942
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:17,074
That's assuming of course that they
are still your people, and not Maroni's.

943
01:26:20,305 --> 01:26:22,353
Does it depress you, commissioner?

944
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:28,002
To know just how alone you really are?

945
01:26:30,307 --> 01:26:34,926
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

946
01:26:34,965 --> 01:26:35,954
Where is he?

947
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:37,972
What's the time?

948
01:26:38,617 --> 01:26:39,936
What difference does that make?

949
01:26:39,984 --> 01:26:45,104
Well, depending on the time,
he may in one spot or several.

950
01:26:51,818 --> 01:26:59,680
If we're gonna play games...
I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

951
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:03,835
Ah, the good cop, bad cop routine?

952
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:06,274
Not exactly.

953
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:20,461
Never start with the head, the victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel...

954
01:27:23,566 --> 01:27:24,749
See?

955
01:27:24,795 --> 01:27:27,275
You wanted me. Here I am.

956
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:32,913
I wanted to see what you would do.
And you didn't disappoint.

957
01:27:33,776 --> 01:27:36,028
You let five people die.

958
01:27:37,778 --> 01:27:40,895
Then you let
Dent take your place.

959
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:44,026
- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
- Where's Dent?

960
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:48,066
Those mob fools want you gone
so they can get back to the way things were.

961
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,523
But I know the truth.
There's no going back.

962
01:27:52,564 --> 01:27:55,215
You've changed things... Forever.

963
01:27:55,262 --> 01:27:56,877
Then why do you want to kill me?

964
01:27:59,365 --> 01:28:03,085
I don't want to kill you!
What would I do without you?

965
01:28:03,126 --> 01:28:11,318
Go back to ripping off mob dealers?
No, no. No! You... complete me.

966
01:28:11,336 --> 01:28:13,486
You're garbage. You kill for money.

967
01:28:13,532 --> 01:28:15,523
Don't talk like
one of them. You're not!

968
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:23,309
Even if you'd like to be. To them you're
just a freak. Like me.

969
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:25,267
They need you right now.

970
01:28:26,857 --> 01:28:32,409
When they don't,
they'll cast you out.

971
01:28:32,429 --> 01:28:38,481
See there are morals, your code...
it's a bad joke.

972
01:28:39,387 --> 01:28:41,503
Dropped at the first
sign of trouble.

973
01:28:43,523 --> 01:28:45,946
They are only as good as
the world allows them to be.

974
01:28:46,665 --> 01:28:48,553
I'll show you. When the chips are down

975
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:54,683
these civilized people,
they'll eat each other.

976
01:28:55,931 --> 01:29:01,289
See, I'm not a monster.
I'm just ahead of the curve.

977
01:29:03,183 --> 01:29:04,195
Where's Dent?

978
01:29:04,231 --> 01:29:07,018
You have all these rules
and you think they'll save you.

979
01:29:10,669 --> 01:29:11,499
He's in control.

980
01:29:11,743 --> 01:29:12,858
I have one rule.

981
01:29:12,909 --> 01:29:16,333
Oh... Then that's the rule you'll
have to break to know the truth...

982
01:29:16,373 --> 01:29:17,362
Which is?

983
01:29:17,376 --> 01:29:20,459
The only sensible way to live
in this world is without rules.

984
01:29:20,501 --> 01:29:23,049
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

985
01:29:23,354 --> 01:29:24,286
I'm considering it.

986
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:28,710
No, there's only minutes left, so you're gonna have to
play my little game if you want to save one of them.

987
01:29:31,634 --> 01:29:37,823
You know for a while there I thought you really
were Dent. The way you threw yourself after her...

988
01:29:45,091 --> 01:29:45,955
Look at you go?

989
01:29:51,433 --> 01:29:54,379
Does Harvey know about
you and his little bunny?

990
01:29:56,073 --> 01:29:57,392
Where are they?

991
01:29:57,426 --> 01:29:59,246
Killing is making a choice.

992
01:29:59,977 --> 01:30:01,092
Where are they?

993
01:30:01,112 --> 01:30:06,835
Choose between one life orthe other.
Yourfriend, the DA, or his blushing bride-to-be?

994
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:20,187
You have nothing to threaten me with.
Nothing to do with all your strength.

995
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:23,220
Don't worry.
I'm gonna tell you where they are.

996
01:30:23,246 --> 01:30:28,400
Both of them. And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

997
01:30:28,441 --> 01:30:35,461
He's at 25052nd street.
And she's on Avenue X, at Cicero.

998
01:30:37,196 --> 01:30:38,948
- Which one you going after?
- Rachel.

999
01:30:40,415 --> 01:30:41,461
We're getting Dent!

1000
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:45,796
25052nd street!

1001
01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:54,171
Hello! Can anybody hear me?

1002
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:59,073
Hello!

1003
01:31:03,956 --> 01:31:05,708
- Rachel?
- Harvey!

1004
01:31:05,736 --> 01:31:08,853
Oh, Harvey! Thank God!
Are you okay?

1005
01:31:08,872 --> 01:31:14,128
I'm alright. I'm in a warehouse.
They've got me wired to these oil drums.

1006
01:31:14,948 --> 01:31:17,405
I am too.
Harvey...

1007
01:31:25,941 --> 01:31:29,934
I want... I want my phone call.
I want my phone call!

1008
01:31:29,949 --> 01:31:30,938
I want my phone call.

1009
01:31:31,998 --> 01:31:32,953
That's nice.

1010
01:31:35,232 --> 01:31:39,384
How many of your friends have I killed?

1011
01:31:43,727 --> 01:31:44,978
I'm a twenty year man.

1012
01:31:45,008 --> 01:31:48,364
I know the difference between punks
who need a little lesson in manners...

1013
01:31:48,387 --> 01:31:50,810
and the freaks like you
who just enjoy it.

1014
01:31:52,519 --> 01:31:54,601
And you've killed six of my friends.

1015
01:31:56,516 --> 01:31:58,837
Please. My insides hurt.

1016
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,427
I don't really care! Back away.

1017
01:32:00,489 --> 01:32:03,174
The boss said that
he'd make the voices go away.

1018
01:32:04,023 --> 01:32:06,742
He said he'd go inside and
replace them with bright lights.

1019
01:32:07,644 --> 01:32:08,895
Like Christmas!

1020
01:32:08,916 --> 01:32:10,838
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off!

1021
01:32:11,437 --> 01:32:14,019
Medic right away in the holding
deck. Come on, get the door open.

1022
01:32:15,014 --> 01:32:16,197
You guys back off!

1023
01:32:16,246 --> 01:32:22,572
Listen, we don't have a lot of time. He told me
that only one of us was going to make it.

1024
01:32:22,597 --> 01:32:24,781
And that they were
going to let our friends choose.

1025
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:34,616
Okay, Rachel. It's going to be fine. It going
to be all right. They're coming for you.

1026
01:32:34,652 --> 01:32:38,736
Okay. I'll help you. Talk me through
with what's going on with you.

1027
01:32:39,411 --> 01:32:41,299
Can find anything sharp?

1028
01:32:41,677 --> 01:32:42,575
I'm trying.

1029
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:46,006
What... Harvey?

1030
01:32:50,543 --> 01:32:51,726
Harvey, what's happening?

1031
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:05,437
All available units.
Converge to 25052nd street.

1032
01:33:05,861 --> 01:33:09,979
Do you want to know
why I use a knife?

1033
01:33:12,110 --> 01:33:19,801
Guns are too quick. You can't
savor all the little emotion.

1034
01:33:21,905 --> 01:33:29,391
You see... In their last moments
people show you who they really are.

1035
01:33:30,664 --> 01:33:35,749
So, in a way I know your
friends better than you ever did.

1036
01:33:40,251 --> 01:33:42,640
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1037
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:55,336
- What's that?
- He's got some kind of a contusion.

1038
01:33:55,362 --> 01:34:01,722
I know you're going to enjoy this.
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it even more.

1039
01:34:11,252 --> 01:34:12,605
Easy! Easy!

1040
01:34:12,646 --> 01:34:18,767
Drop the weapon now! Let him go now!
Drop the weapon!

1041
01:34:18,798 --> 01:34:20,948
- Sorry.
- What do you want?

1042
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:24,179
Ljust want my phone call.

1043
01:34:27,568 --> 01:34:29,490
What... What's happening?

1044
01:34:30,693 --> 01:34:32,479
Just talk to me
for one second.

1045
01:34:35,744 --> 01:34:36,438
Alright.

1046
01:34:50,299 --> 01:34:52,051
Is that a... phone?

1047
01:35:02,087 --> 01:35:03,133
Mount the curb!

1048
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:15,286
Harvey... just in case,
I want to tell you something.

1049
01:35:15,331 --> 01:35:17,117
Don't think like that, Rachel!
They're coming foryou.

1050
01:35:17,153 --> 01:35:19,405
I know they are.
But I don't want them to.

1051
01:35:23,939 --> 01:35:27,124
I don't want to live without you and
I do have an answer for you.

1052
01:35:28,287 --> 01:35:29,970
My answer is yes.

1053
01:35:32,826 --> 01:35:39,720
No! No! No! Not me. Why
are you coming for me? No!

1054
01:35:41,284 --> 01:35:43,002
Rachel! Rachel!

1055
01:35:43,265 --> 01:35:46,587
Harvey... Okay.

1056
01:35:50,029 --> 01:35:54,921
Harvey, it's okay. It's alright.
Listen. Some...

1057
01:36:01,516 --> 01:36:02,631
No!

1058
01:36:02,959 --> 01:36:05,280
Rachel! No!

1059
01:36:20,209 --> 01:36:21,198
Hello there.

1060
01:36:27,206 --> 01:36:29,663
Back at the MCU
the Joker's gone.

1061
01:36:31,461 --> 01:36:32,416
With Lau?

1062
01:36:35,739 --> 01:36:41,257
The Joker planned to be caught.
He wanted me to lock him up in the MCU.

1063
01:37:00,603 --> 01:37:01,535
Dear Bruce.

1064
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:06,401
I need to be honest and clear.

1065
01:37:09,167 --> 01:37:10,850
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1066
01:37:11,929 --> 01:37:15,217
I love him and I want to spend
the rest of my life with him.

1067
01:37:16,328 --> 01:37:18,273
When I told you that if
Gotham not longer needed

1068
01:37:18,324 --> 01:37:21,873
Batman we could be
together, I meant it.

1069
01:37:23,326 --> 01:37:27,945
But now I'm sure the day won't come when
you no longer need Batman.

1070
01:37:29,091 --> 01:37:36,111
I hope it does. And if it does,
I'll be there. But as your friend.

1071
01:37:36,805 --> 01:37:38,158
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1072
01:37:39,223 --> 01:37:40,702
I'm sorry I let you down.

1073
01:37:41,492 --> 01:37:45,576
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1074
01:37:47,347 --> 01:37:50,896
Love, now and always,
Rachel.

1075
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:01,252
I prepared a little breakfast.

1076
01:38:05,904 --> 01:38:06,984
Very well, then...

1077
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:08,230
Alfred.

1078
01:38:08,278 --> 01:38:09,267
Yes, Master Wayne.

1079
01:38:10,505 --> 01:38:12,086
Should I bring this on her?

1080
01:38:13,896 --> 01:38:19,016
I was meant to inspire good.
Not madness, not death.

1081
01:38:19,049 --> 01:38:23,565
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1082
01:38:23,606 --> 01:38:28,532
Didrt you think there might be some casualties? Things
are always going to get worse before they get better.

1083
01:38:28,543 --> 01:38:30,056
But Rachel, Alfred...

1084
01:38:30,103 --> 01:38:35,757
Rachel believed in what you
stood for. What we stand for.

1085
01:38:35,781 --> 01:38:37,794
Gotham needs you.

1086
01:38:38,374 --> 01:38:40,422
No. Gotham needs
its true hero.

1087
01:38:41,906 --> 01:38:45,990
And I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1088
01:38:46,012 --> 01:38:51,006
Which is why for now they're
going to have to make do with you.

1089
01:38:53,311 --> 01:38:55,302
She was going to wait for me, Alfred.

1090
01:38:57,019 --> 01:39:00,500
Dent doesn't know.
He can never know.

1091
01:39:03,167 --> 01:39:05,886
- What's that?
- It could wait.

1092
01:39:06,559 --> 01:39:11,781
That bandit in the forest,
in Burma. Did you catch him?

1093
01:39:11,813 --> 01:39:12,802
Yes.

1094
01:39:12,815 --> 01:39:13,804
How?

1095
01:39:15,746 --> 01:39:17,202
We burned the forest down.

1096
01:39:56,367 --> 01:39:59,313
He's a credible source.
An MNA lawyer from a prestigious consultancy.

1097
01:39:59,365 --> 01:40:02,380
He says he's waited as long as he can
forthe Batman to do the right thing.

1098
01:40:02,952 --> 01:40:04,806
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1099
01:40:05,309 --> 01:40:07,630
We'll be live at 5 with the
true identity of the Batman.

1100
01:40:24,517 --> 01:40:26,337
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1101
01:40:29,047 --> 01:40:32,904
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but you won't accept medication.

1102
01:40:34,819 --> 01:40:38,539
That you're refusing
to accept skin grafts.

1103
01:40:38,557 --> 01:40:46,487
You remember that name you all had for
me when I was at Internal Affairs?

1104
01:40:49,916 --> 01:40:51,031
What was it, Gordon?

1105
01:40:51,577 --> 01:40:52,623
Harvey...

1106
01:40:53,232 --> 01:40:54,130
Say it.

1107
01:40:56,184 --> 01:40:57,333
Say it!

1108
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:08,216
Two Face... Harvey Two Face.

1109
01:41:10,453 --> 01:41:14,378
Why should I hide who I am?

1110
01:41:16,244 --> 01:41:17,791
I know you tried to warn me.

1111
01:41:18,414 --> 01:41:19,244
I'm sorry.

1112
01:41:20,466 --> 01:41:23,082
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1113
01:41:25,341 --> 01:41:27,525
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1114
01:41:28,313 --> 01:41:31,396
Harvey, I need to know which
of my men I can trust.

1115
01:41:31,447 --> 01:41:33,631
Why would you listen to me now?

1116
01:41:35,037 --> 01:41:36,493
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1117
01:41:39,104 --> 01:41:45,464
No, no, you're not.
Not yet.

1118
01:41:51,437 --> 01:41:53,621
He's crazy. It's too much...

1119
01:41:53,639 --> 01:41:57,063
You should have thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1120
01:41:57,567 --> 01:41:58,124
You want him?

1121
01:42:01,649 --> 01:42:04,004
I can tell you where
he'll be this afternoon.

1122
01:42:12,009 --> 01:42:14,295
You're not so crazy as you look.

1123
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:17,322
I told you I'm a man of my word.

1124
01:42:21,657 --> 01:42:22,772
Where's the Italian?

1125
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:26,166
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1126
01:42:26,185 --> 01:42:29,700
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1127
01:42:30,487 --> 01:42:35,072
Joker,
What do you do with all your money?

1128
01:42:35,649 --> 01:42:45,547
I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy
dynamite, gunpowder and gasoline!

1129
01:42:47,775 --> 01:42:48,434
But what...?

1130
01:42:51,971 --> 01:42:56,158
And you know the thing that they
have in common? They're cheap.

1131
01:42:56,604 --> 01:42:59,289
I want to know how much they're
paying you to say who Batman really is.

1132
01:42:59,333 --> 01:43:03,258
This is our chance. I want
Lau alive. The Joker... either way.

1133
01:43:03,713 --> 01:43:04,998
Hey, Jim! Get a load of this.

1134
01:43:05,034 --> 01:43:06,023
Let's take the next caller.

1135
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:08,385
Harvey Dent didn't want to give
in to this maniac.

1136
01:43:08,434 --> 01:43:09,651
Do you think you know better than him?

1137
01:43:10,284 --> 01:43:14,141
I think that if we could talk to Dent
today he may feel differently.

1138
01:43:14,171 --> 01:43:18,187
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
God knows we need him now.

1139
01:43:18,235 --> 01:43:20,487
You said you were a man of your word.

1140
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:25,852
Oh, I am! I'm only
burning my half.

1141
01:43:28,666 --> 01:43:30,486
All you care about is money.

1142
01:43:30,952 --> 01:43:33,773
This town deserves a
better class of criminals.

1143
01:43:34,315 --> 01:43:35,771
And I'm gonna give it to them.

1144
01:43:37,629 --> 01:43:39,950
Tell your men
they work for me now.

1145
01:43:39,967 --> 01:43:41,787
This is my city.

1146
01:43:43,256 --> 01:43:45,975
They won't work
for a freak.

1147
01:43:46,011 --> 01:43:49,868
A freak? Why don't we cut
you up into little pieces

1148
01:43:49,905 --> 01:43:56,162
and feed you to your pooches? Hmm?
And then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is.

1149
01:43:57,361 --> 01:44:05,120
It's not about money. It's about
sending a message: Everything burns.

1150
01:44:08,598 --> 01:44:10,520
- Who is this?
- I had a vision.

1151
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:16,399
A world without Batman.
The mob ground out a little profit.

1152
01:44:16,435 --> 01:44:19,950
The police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1153
01:44:19,997 --> 01:44:25,151
And it was so... boring.
I've had a change of heart.

1154
01:44:25,177 --> 01:44:28,829
I don't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything.

1155
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:31,020
But why should I have all the fun?

1156
01:44:31,048 --> 01:44:33,403
Let's give someone else a chance.

1157
01:44:33,425 --> 01:44:40,513
If Coleman Reese isn't dead in
60 minutes then I blow up a hospital.

1158
01:44:40,535 --> 01:44:44,221
I want you to call in every officer.
Tell them to head to their nearest hospital.

1159
01:44:44,238 --> 01:44:45,785
And start evac and search.

1160
01:44:45,837 --> 01:44:47,885
Call the transport authority,
school board, prisons.

1161
01:44:47,914 --> 01:44:49,734
Get every available by stander
to a hospital.

1162
01:44:49,767 --> 01:44:54,625
The priority is Gotham General.
Wheel everybody out of that place now!

1163
01:44:54,656 --> 01:44:56,237
You, you and you. Come with me.

1164
01:44:56,276 --> 01:44:57,265
Where are we going, Sir?

1165
01:44:57,278 --> 01:44:58,290
To get Reese.

1166
01:44:58,650 --> 01:45:01,801
I need you plugged in checking
Gordors men and their families.

1167
01:45:02,306 --> 01:45:02,965
Looking for?

1168
01:45:02,981 --> 01:45:04,232
Hospital admissions.

1169
01:45:04,266 --> 01:45:06,257
Will you be wanting the Batpod, sir?

1170
01:45:06,274 --> 01:45:08,287
In the middle of the day, Alfred?
Not very subtle.

1171
01:45:08,322 --> 01:45:11,906
The Lamborghini, then?
Much more subtle...

1172
01:45:25,894 --> 01:45:27,782
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me.

1173
01:45:28,417 --> 01:45:31,102
Sir, could you help, please?

1174
01:45:32,195 --> 01:45:33,480
Go find a bus for him.

1175
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:39,496
Sir, commissioner. Do you really think an
ordinary citizen will try to kill this man?

1176
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:02,707
See Brian Richards.

1177
01:46:03,278 --> 01:46:06,634
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1178
01:46:08,054 --> 01:46:10,477
- They're trying to kill me.
- Maybe the Batman can save you.

1179
01:46:24,735 --> 01:46:26,384
Davis, I got space.
Bring him out.

1180
01:46:29,069 --> 01:46:29,831
Davis!

1181
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:37,994
I saw Burns and there's Zachary.

1182
01:46:38,633 --> 01:46:39,748
Nothing on them.

1183
01:46:39,782 --> 01:46:41,261
And a patrolman I don't know.

1184
01:46:42,788 --> 01:46:44,107
So what now...

1185
01:46:45,973 --> 01:46:47,122
Where are we going?

1186
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:51,775
Send the information to Gordon.

1187
01:46:59,851 --> 01:47:01,068
Get out of here.

1188
01:47:03,587 --> 01:47:04,383
Davis!

1189
01:47:08,477 --> 01:47:09,865
Ma'am, we're going to
have to move him now...

1190
01:47:22,574 --> 01:47:23,962
It's Berg, isn't it?

1191
01:47:24,007 --> 01:47:24,996
Commissioner.

1192
01:47:26,111 --> 01:47:27,294
You okay, son?

1193
01:47:44,102 --> 01:47:45,387
Hi.

1194
01:47:50,374 --> 01:47:51,489
You know.

1195
01:47:52,613 --> 01:47:55,798
I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1196
01:47:56,295 --> 01:47:58,115
When you and uh...

1197
01:47:58,165 --> 01:47:59,245
Rachel!

1198
01:47:59,268 --> 01:48:04,023
...Rachel were being abducted I was
sitting in Gordon's cage.

1199
01:48:05,257 --> 01:48:07,270
I didn't rig those charges.

1200
01:48:07,312 --> 01:48:09,200
Your men, your plan.

1201
01:48:09,977 --> 01:48:12,093
Do I really look like a
guy with a plan?

1202
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:15,937
You know what I am? I'm a dog
chasing cars.

1203
01:48:15,979 --> 01:48:18,493
I wouldn't know what to do
with one if I caught it!

1204
01:48:18,972 --> 01:48:21,486
You know, I just do things.

1205
01:48:22,323 --> 01:48:26,145
The mob has plans,
the cops have plans.

1206
01:48:26,177 --> 01:48:30,932
Gordors got plans.
They're schemers.

1207
01:48:31,633 --> 01:48:34,887
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1208
01:48:35,797 --> 01:48:41,349
I'm not a schemer. I try to show
the schemers how pathetic

1209
01:48:41,374 --> 01:48:44,423
their attempts to control
things really are.

1210
01:48:45,389 --> 01:48:47,846
So... When I say...

1211
01:48:47,881 --> 01:48:48,870
Come here.

1212
01:48:48,883 --> 01:48:52,569
When I say that you and your
girlfriend was nothing personal...

1213
01:48:54,279 --> 01:48:55,894
You know that I'm telling the truth.

1214
01:48:58,959 --> 01:49:00,278
I'm going to need your weapon.

1215
01:49:00,981 --> 01:49:01,572
What?

1216
01:49:05,316 --> 01:49:07,170
Why? Because my
wife is in the hospital?

1217
01:49:07,889 --> 01:49:09,277
Yeah. That would be why.

1218
01:49:10,278 --> 01:49:13,702
It's the schemers that
put you where you are.

1219
01:49:13,726 --> 01:49:19,847
You were a schemer. You had
plans. And look where that got you.

1220
01:49:30,888 --> 01:49:33,072
The police force are taking every
possible precaution

1221
01:49:33,110 --> 01:49:35,260
urging everyone not to take matters
into their own hands.

1222
01:49:35,625 --> 01:49:41,712
I just did what I do best. I took your
little plan and I turned it on itself.

1223
01:49:41,744 --> 01:49:43,860
Look what I did to
this city with a few

1224
01:49:43,904 --> 01:49:46,828
drums of gas
and a couple of bullets.

1225
01:49:49,049 --> 01:49:50,698
You know... You know what I noticed?

1226
01:49:50,747 --> 01:49:53,636
Nobody panics when things
go according to plan.

1227
01:49:54,798 --> 01:49:56,584
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1228
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:01,822
If tomorrow I tell the press that
like a gangbanger will get shot

1229
01:50:01,847 --> 01:50:07,331
or a truckload of soldiers will be
blown up, nobody panics.

1230
01:50:07,910 --> 01:50:10,856
Because it's all part of the plan.

1231
01:50:11,107 --> 01:50:15,191
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1232
01:50:16,024 --> 01:50:18,037
Well then everybody loses their minds!

1233
01:50:21,983 --> 01:50:23,871
Introduce a little anarchy.

1234
01:50:26,226 --> 01:50:32,381
Upset the established order.
And everything becomes chaos.

1235
01:50:34,946 --> 01:50:36,698
I'm an agent of chaos.

1236
01:50:38,104 --> 01:50:40,026
Oh, and you know the thing about chaos?

1237
01:50:42,430 --> 01:50:43,977
It's fair.

1238
01:50:53,397 --> 01:50:54,580
You live...

1239
01:50:57,073 --> 01:50:58,290
You die...

1240
01:50:59,365 --> 01:51:00,946
Now we're talking!

1241
01:51:10,259 --> 01:51:10,953
Mr. Reese...

1242
01:51:29,856 --> 01:51:34,111
It's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?
That was a very brave thing you did.

1243
01:51:34,134 --> 01:51:35,317
Trying to catch the light?

1244
01:51:35,358 --> 01:51:37,110
You weren't protecting the Van?

1245
01:51:37,158 --> 01:51:38,341
Why? Who's in it?

1246
01:51:43,857 --> 01:51:45,973
Do you think I should
go to the hospital?

1247
01:51:45,996 --> 01:51:48,715
You don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1248
01:52:54,743 --> 01:53:00,830
Southeast... That's Gotham general.
Did you clear the building?

1249
01:53:04,511 --> 01:53:07,162
We must know how many were inside!
You got patient lists, role calls.

1250
01:53:07,206 --> 01:53:10,061
Right now, we're showing
fifty people missing. One bus.

1251
01:53:10,078 --> 01:53:13,593
All these others buses are heading off
to other hospitals. My guess is we missed one.

1252
01:53:13,613 --> 01:53:15,626
Yeah? Well, what's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1253
01:53:15,668 --> 01:53:17,249
Keep looking.
And keep it to yourself.

1254
01:53:17,293 --> 01:53:19,215
Now if anybody asks, we got him out.

1255
01:53:22,727 --> 01:53:24,080
Get the mayor's office on the line.

1256
01:53:26,348 --> 01:53:28,031
We're going to need the national guard.

1257
01:53:28,413 --> 01:53:31,200
Fifty people are missing,
including GCN's own Michael Engel.

1258
01:53:31,227 --> 01:53:34,981
I'm now being told that we're
cutting to a video GCN has just received.

1259
01:53:35,004 --> 01:53:39,759
I'm Michael Engel for Gotham Tonight. What
does it take to make you people want to join in?

1260
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:46,392
You failed to kill the lawyer. I've got to
get you off the bench and into the game.

1261
01:53:47,639 --> 01:53:52,292
Come night fall this city is mine. And
anyone left here plays by my rules.

1262
01:53:52,624 --> 01:53:56,276
Mr. Fox, security is showing a
break-in at the RND department.

1263
01:53:56,302 --> 01:54:00,022
If you don't want to be
in the game. Get out now.

1264
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:07,169
But the bridge and tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise. HA HA! HA HA!

1265
01:54:41,714 --> 01:54:43,193
Sweet Jesus!

1266
01:54:45,043 --> 01:54:48,092
Shouldn't you be out there?
Doing something?

1267
01:54:48,568 --> 01:54:49,614
It is my day off.

1268
01:54:51,173 --> 01:54:52,071
I got to take a leak.

1269
01:54:53,183 --> 01:54:54,639
Keep an eye out for me.

1270
01:55:00,812 --> 01:55:03,133
Now what? You need
someone to shake it foryou?

1271
01:55:03,147 --> 01:55:04,136
Hello.

1272
01:55:05,353 --> 01:55:06,047
Dent?

1273
01:55:07,058 --> 01:55:09,242
Jesus... I thought
you was dead.

1274
01:55:09,518 --> 01:55:10,633
Half.

1275
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:18,621
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1276
01:55:18,671 --> 01:55:20,252
Must have been Maroni's men.

1277
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:21,269
Shut up!

1278
01:55:22,748 --> 01:55:26,866
Are you telling me that you're going to
protect the othertraitor in Gordors unit?

1279
01:55:26,905 --> 01:55:27,894
I don't know! He nevertold me.

1280
01:55:28,446 --> 01:55:31,028
Listen, Dent. I swear to God I didn't know
what they were going to do with you.

1281
01:55:33,755 --> 01:55:34,483
That's funny.

1282
01:55:36,738 --> 01:55:38,387
Because I don't know what's
going to happen to you either.

1283
01:55:43,412 --> 01:55:45,232
Beautiful, isn't it?

1284
01:55:45,839 --> 01:55:51,459
Beautiful, unethical, dangerous.

1285
01:55:51,492 --> 01:55:55,383
You've turned every cell phone
in Gotham into a microphone.

1286
01:55:55,417 --> 01:55:57,772
And a high-frequency generator receiver.

1287
01:55:58,247 --> 01:56:03,332
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1288
01:56:03,353 --> 01:56:07,005
With half the city feeding you sonar
you can image all of Gotham.

1289
01:56:09,873 --> 01:56:11,329
This is wrong.

1290
01:56:11,349 --> 01:56:13,294
I've got to find this man, Lucius.

1291
01:56:15,375 --> 01:56:16,558
At what cost?

1292
01:56:17,065 --> 01:56:22,014
The database is null-key encrypted.
It can only be accessed by one person.

1293
01:56:23,451 --> 01:56:25,567
This is too much powerfor one person.

1294
01:56:25,608 --> 01:56:27,087
That's why I
gave it to you.

1295
01:56:28,434 --> 01:56:29,514
Only you can use it.

1296
01:56:29,963 --> 01:56:33,615
Spying on 30 million people isn't
part of my job description.

1297
01:56:36,013 --> 01:56:37,162
This is an audio signal.

1298
01:56:37,206 --> 01:56:41,563
It feeds off within range of any phone
the city you can triangulate its position.

1299
01:56:42,143 --> 01:56:43,997
I'll help you this one time.

1300
01:56:45,368 --> 01:56:47,120
But consider this my resignation.

1301
01:56:47,157 --> 01:56:51,309
As long as this machine is at
Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1302
01:56:52,912 --> 01:56:56,769
When you finish,
type in your name.

1303
01:57:05,214 --> 01:57:08,331
My office is looking over every
inch of the tunnels and bridges,

1304
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:11,269
but with the Joker's threat
there are limited options.

1305
01:57:11,301 --> 01:57:12,620
And land routes east?

1306
01:57:13,170 --> 01:57:14,068
Backed up for hours.

1307
01:57:14,638 --> 01:57:17,892
We'Il just release the ferries.
With thirty thousand ready to board.

1308
01:57:18,372 --> 01:57:21,455
Plus I want to use the ferries so I can
get some of those prisoners off the island.

1309
01:57:22,246 --> 01:57:24,931
The men you and Dent put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1310
01:57:24,949 --> 01:57:26,701
You should be. Whatever
the Joker's planning

1311
01:57:26,743 --> 01:57:29,394
it's a good bet that Harvey's
prisoners might be involved.

1312
01:57:29,415 --> 01:57:30,530
I want to get them out of here.

1313
01:57:33,035 --> 01:57:34,150
So where is Harvey?

1314
01:57:34,657 --> 01:57:35,772
We haven't found him.

1315
01:57:36,327 --> 01:57:37,123
Jesus...

1316
01:57:41,627 --> 01:57:43,379
How long can you keep this quiet?

1317
01:57:57,908 --> 01:58:00,229
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing!

1318
01:58:01,677 --> 01:58:02,792
Going to join your wife?

1319
01:58:07,086 --> 01:58:08,041
You love her?

1320
01:58:09,132 --> 01:58:09,689
Yes.

1321
01:58:10,634 --> 01:58:13,114
You ever imagine what it would
be like to listen to her die?

1322
01:58:13,164 --> 01:58:19,854
Look take it up with the Joker. He killed
your woman. He made you... like this.

1323
01:58:20,245 --> 01:58:22,133
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1324
01:58:23,519 --> 01:58:25,373
I want whoever let
him off the leash.

1325
01:58:26,921 --> 01:58:30,436
I took care of Wuertz. Who is your
other man inside Gordon's unit?

1326
01:58:30,469 --> 01:58:32,926
Who picked up Rachel? It must have
been someone she trusted.

1327
01:58:34,528 --> 01:58:37,679
Look, if I tell you
you'll let me go?

1328
01:58:38,042 --> 01:58:39,760
Can't hurt your chances.

1329
01:58:42,332 --> 01:58:44,584
It was Ramirez.

1330
01:58:49,676 --> 01:58:50,199
But you said...

1331
01:58:50,222 --> 01:58:51,940
I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1332
01:58:56,382 --> 01:58:57,861
You're a lucky man.

1333
01:59:02,072 --> 01:59:03,323
But he's not.

1334
01:59:03,343 --> 01:59:04,332
Who?

1335
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:08,159
Your driver.

1336
01:59:22,662 --> 01:59:24,710
Hey, man! We should
be on that boat!

1337
01:59:24,756 --> 01:59:27,008
You want to ride a bus with them?
Be my guest.

1338
01:59:50,772 --> 01:59:51,887
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1339
01:59:52,731 --> 01:59:53,846
Right. Get on the radio.

1340
01:59:53,874 --> 01:59:57,093
Tell them we'll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scum bags.

1341
01:59:57,569 --> 01:59:59,423
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.

1342
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:03,229
What the heck was that?

1343
02:00:07,304 --> 02:00:11,161
Liberty, come in please. This is Spirit.

1344
02:00:11,199 --> 02:00:13,918
We have the same problem.
We lost both engines.

1345
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:17,288
Fox. There's something going on
on the ferries.

1346
02:00:19,264 --> 02:00:20,811
Get down to the engine room now

1347
02:00:32,854 --> 02:00:36,506
Captain, we got a hundreds barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1348
02:00:52,526 --> 02:00:55,415
Why would they give us the detonator
to our own bomb?

1349
02:00:58,302 --> 02:01:01,294
Tonight you are all going to
be part of a social experiment

1350
02:01:05,606 --> 02:01:09,258
For the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate

1351
02:01:09,302 --> 02:01:13,295
I am ready right now
to blow you all sky high

1352
02:01:13,726 --> 02:01:15,045
Liberty, come in. Over.

1353
02:01:17,629 --> 02:01:18,778
It's dead.

1354
02:01:18,825 --> 02:01:23,012
Anyone attempts to get
off their boat, you all die.

1355
02:01:23,658 --> 02:01:24,590
I'm zeroing in.

1356
02:01:25,073 --> 02:01:29,828
Each of you has a remote
to blow off the other boat.

1357
02:01:30,355 --> 02:01:31,868
The voice is on the ferry.

1358
02:01:32,891 --> 02:01:34,643
But it's not the source.

1359
02:01:36,675 --> 02:01:37,664
West!

1360
02:01:45,274 --> 02:01:47,162
- Gordon.
- I have the Joker's location.

1361
02:01:47,618 --> 02:01:48,346
Prewitt Building.

1362
02:01:48,866 --> 02:01:50,254
Put some along
the building offices.

1363
02:01:52,808 --> 02:01:55,231
At midnight I blow you all up.

1364
02:01:55,579 --> 02:02:00,403
If however one of you presses the
button, I'll let that boat live.

1365
02:02:00,973 --> 02:02:06,366
So whose it going to be? Harvey Dent's
most-wanted scum bag collection?

1366
02:02:06,387 --> 02:02:11,507
Or the sweet and innocent civilians?
You choose.

1367
02:02:11,544 --> 02:02:14,490
Oh! And you might want
to decide quickly because...

1368
02:02:14,529 --> 02:02:18,989
the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

1369
02:02:25,810 --> 02:02:26,708
Stay back!

1370
02:02:27,481 --> 02:02:31,167
Well who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over at least.

1371
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:34,714
We don't have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1372
02:02:35,499 --> 02:02:37,956
We are not going to talk about this.

1373
02:02:37,970 --> 02:02:39,517
Why aren't we talking about it?

1374
02:02:39,542 --> 02:02:42,466
They're talking over the
same exact thing on the other boat.

1375
02:02:42,491 --> 02:02:43,480
Let's put it to a vote.

1376
02:02:50,017 --> 02:02:50,711
Hello?

1377
02:02:50,745 --> 02:02:52,224
Barbara. It's Anna Ramirez.

1378
02:02:52,746 --> 02:02:55,829
Jim needs you to pack up and
put the kids in the car right away.

1379
02:02:55,875 --> 02:02:57,695
But the unit's outside?

1380
02:02:57,723 --> 02:02:59,441
Those cops can't be trusted.

1381
02:02:59,487 --> 02:03:02,308
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1382
02:03:02,694 --> 02:03:05,913
I'll call them off for ten minutes.
And you'll have to move fast.

1383
02:03:05,932 --> 02:03:07,615
Where am I supposed to take them?

1384
02:03:07,637 --> 02:03:11,858
25052nd Street.
Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.

1385
02:03:11,892 --> 02:03:12,881
Okay.

1386
02:03:13,626 --> 02:03:14,558
Did she believe you?

1387
02:03:15,639 --> 02:03:16,754
That's because she trusts you.

1388
02:03:18,107 --> 02:03:19,290
Just like Rachel did.

1389
02:03:19,326 --> 02:03:20,315
I didn't know...

1390
02:03:20,328 --> 02:03:21,317
Didn't know what they were going to do?

1391
02:03:21,329 --> 02:03:23,809
You're the second cop
to say that to me.

1392
02:03:24,706 --> 02:03:26,719
What exactly did you
think they were going to do?

1393
02:03:26,765 --> 02:03:29,518
They got me early on. My mother's
hospital bills...

1394
02:03:29,564 --> 02:03:30,553
Don't!

1395
02:03:31,978 --> 02:03:32,774
I'm sorry...

1396
02:03:32,982 --> 02:03:34,768
You live to fight
another day, office.

1397
02:03:39,131 --> 02:03:40,450
We found the missing hospital bus.

1398
02:03:40,493 --> 02:03:42,484
And we have a hostage situation.

1399
02:03:44,882 --> 02:03:49,672
It's a shooting gallery. Why would he
choose a spot with such good windows?

1400
02:03:49,686 --> 02:03:53,634
We have clear shots on five clowns. The
snipers take them out, smash the windows,

1401
02:03:53,674 --> 02:03:56,325
A team repels in,
a team moves in by the stairwells.

1402
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:58,282
Two, three casualties max.

1403
02:03:58,783 --> 02:03:59,306
Let's do it.

1404
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:00,455
It's not that simple.

1405
02:04:00,501 --> 02:04:02,014
With the Joker it never is.

1406
02:04:02,055 --> 02:04:06,480
What's simple is that every second we don't take in
those
people on the ferries get closer to blowing each other
up

1407
02:04:06,523 --> 02:04:07,512
That won't happen.

1408
02:04:07,773 --> 02:04:09,627
Then he'll blow both of them up!

1409
02:04:09,648 --> 02:04:10,546
We don't have time for paper.

1410
02:04:10,554 --> 02:04:14,376
I want everybody to put their
votes on this piece of paper.

1411
02:04:16,431 --> 02:04:19,685
If anyone's got a pen pass it along.

1412
02:04:23,728 --> 02:04:25,980
We need to get the votes in quickly.

1413
02:04:35,782 --> 02:04:37,500
I need five minutes alone.

1414
02:04:37,527 --> 02:04:39,540
No! There's no time!

1415
02:04:39,567 --> 02:04:44,083
We have clear shots! Dent is in there
with them. We have to save Dent.

1416
02:04:44,122 --> 02:04:47,410
I have to save Dent!

1417
02:04:50,373 --> 02:04:53,092
Two minutes. Then we rush.

1418
02:04:58,461 --> 02:05:00,281
Fox, I need picture.

1419
02:05:03,303 --> 02:05:05,692
- Hello?
Jim, we're in trouble!

1420
02:05:06,931 --> 02:05:11,413
Okay. We got POV on alpha.
Unveiling beta.

1421
02:05:14,008 --> 02:05:16,465
It looks like clowns and hostages on 2 floors.

1422
02:05:17,523 --> 02:05:19,172
A SWAT team on stairwell.

1423
02:05:23,112 --> 02:05:25,364
Another SWAT team on the roof.

1424
02:05:30,163 --> 02:05:31,095
Barbara, calm down!

1425
02:05:31,125 --> 02:05:32,547
He has the kids!

1426
02:05:32,885 --> 02:05:34,307
Hello Jim...

1427
02:05:35,321 --> 02:05:38,267
Harvey, where's my family?

1428
02:05:38,315 --> 02:05:40,260
Where my family died.

1429
02:05:43,486 --> 02:05:45,272
Blue Team, acquire the target.

1430
02:06:04,921 --> 02:06:08,311
Fox, the SWAT's targeting the wrong people.
The clowns are the hostages.

1431
02:06:09,457 --> 02:06:11,675
Red Team go!

1432
02:06:20,633 --> 02:06:21,463
Don't move.

1433
02:06:22,858 --> 02:06:23,973
Take the shoot!

1434
02:06:30,022 --> 02:06:31,501
Those SWATs are coming in hard.

1435
02:06:31,553 --> 02:06:33,475
Clowm, put down your gun!

1436
02:06:36,852 --> 02:06:39,400
Doctors get down, clear the line of fire!

1437
02:07:04,963 --> 02:07:06,009
Freeze!

1438
02:07:14,167 --> 02:07:16,158
You see those bad
guys on the floor above?

1439
02:07:16,479 --> 02:07:19,994
They're waiting for help with the
SWAT team coming up the elevator.

1440
02:07:20,478 --> 02:07:21,627
60 seconds.

1441
02:07:30,014 --> 02:07:34,303
The tally is 140 against,
396 for.

1442
02:07:42,399 --> 02:07:44,549
So go ahead, do it!

1443
02:07:44,999 --> 02:07:46,387
We're still here.

1444
02:07:48,508 --> 02:07:50,863
That means. They haven't
killed us either.

1445
02:08:01,716 --> 02:08:03,263
Truouble on the floor above.

1446
02:08:22,937 --> 02:08:25,929
Freeze!
Or we'll shoot!

1447
02:08:31,798 --> 02:08:33,789
We got him, he's out of the game.

1448
02:08:35,443 --> 02:08:36,694
Step away from the edge!

1449
02:09:00,414 --> 02:09:01,039
Don't move!

1450
02:09:11,294 --> 02:09:13,910
Ah, you made it!
I'm so thrilled.

1451
02:09:13,962 --> 02:09:15,782
Where's the detonator?

1452
02:09:16,492 --> 02:09:17,481
- Go get him!

1453
02:10:04,585 --> 02:10:08,510
You don't want to die,
but you don't know how to take a life.

1454
02:10:09,421 --> 02:10:16,008
Give it to me. That man
will kill you and take it anyway.

1455
02:10:19,383 --> 02:10:21,203
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1456
02:10:21,986 --> 02:10:24,443
Fine, I'll do it.

1457
02:10:26,603 --> 02:10:31,859
Those men on that boat. They made
their choices. They chose to murder and steal.

1458
02:10:31,887 --> 02:10:34,503
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1459
02:10:44,147 --> 02:10:46,798
Oh the old familiar places!

1460
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:07,688
Hostages are safe.

1461
02:11:08,851 --> 02:11:09,966
Give it to me.

1462
02:11:12,068 --> 02:11:15,287
You can tell I took it by force.

1463
02:11:16,455 --> 02:11:21,575
Give it to me and I'll do what
you should have did 10 minutes ago.

1464
02:11:43,428 --> 02:11:46,613
We really should stop this fighting.
Otherwise, we'll miss the fireworks!

1465
02:11:46,632 --> 02:11:52,491
- There won't be any fireworks.
- And here... we... go!

1466
02:12:31,644 --> 02:12:36,798
What were you trying to prove?
That deep down, everyone's as ugly as you're?

1467
02:12:37,859 --> 02:12:39,315
You're alone!

1468
02:12:45,247 --> 02:12:50,503
You can't rely on anyone these days,
you got to do everything yourself, don't we?

1469
02:12:50,542 --> 02:12:53,557
That's okay. I came prepared.

1470
02:12:54,586 --> 02:12:55,974
It's a funny world that we live in.

1471
02:12:55,991 --> 02:12:58,744
Speaking of which you know how I got these scars?

1472
02:12:58,780 --> 02:13:01,465
No, but I know how you got these!

1473
02:13:19,977 --> 02:13:26,200
Ugh, you. You just
couldn't let me go, could you?

1474
02:13:26,224 --> 02:13:34,120
This is what happens when an unstoppable
force meets an immovable object.

1475
02:13:35,602 --> 02:13:40,926
You... truly are... incorruptible,
aren't you, huh?

1476
02:13:42,482 --> 02:13:49,877
You won't kill me out of some
misplaced sense of self-righteousness

1477
02:13:50,619 --> 02:13:57,377
And I won't kill you...
because you're just too much fun!

1478
02:13:58,304 --> 02:14:03,059
I think you and I
are destined to do this forever.

1479
02:14:03,282 --> 02:14:05,227
You'll be in a
padded cell forever.

1480
02:14:05,455 --> 02:14:06,012
Maybe we could share one!

1481
02:14:07,318 --> 02:14:11,573
You know, they'll be doubling up the rate
this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.

1482
02:14:11,619 --> 02:14:19,207
This city just showed you that it's
full of people ready to believe in good.

1483
02:14:19,250 --> 02:14:22,504
Until their spirit breaks completely!

1484
02:14:23,343 --> 02:14:27,097
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent

1485
02:14:28,135 --> 02:14:30,956
and all the heroic things he's done.

1486
02:14:32,377 --> 02:14:36,268
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle

1487
02:14:36,290 --> 02:14:39,805
for Gotham's soul
in a fist fight with you?

1488
02:14:42,926 --> 02:14:48,580
No. You need an ace
in the hole. Mine's Harvey.

1489
02:14:48,606 --> 02:14:50,392
What did you do?

1490
02:14:50,415 --> 02:14:57,503
I took Gotham's "White Knight" and I...
brought him down to our level.

1491
02:14:58,014 --> 02:15:03,839
It wasn't hard. You see, madness,
as you know, is like gravity.

1492
02:15:04,256 --> 02:15:07,202
All it takes is a little push!

1493
02:15:46,240 --> 02:15:50,188
This is where they brought her, Gordon...
after your men handed her over.

1494
02:15:51,721 --> 02:15:53,439
This is where she died.

1495
02:15:53,685 --> 02:15:57,769
I know I was here, trying to save her.

1496
02:15:58,278 --> 02:15:59,233
But you didn't.

1497
02:15:59,979 --> 02:16:03,028
- I couldn't.
- Yes, you could have, if you'd listened to me.

1498
02:16:03,147 --> 02:16:05,661
If you stood up against corruption.

1499
02:16:06,085 --> 02:16:08,235
Instead of doing your deal with the devil.

1500
02:16:08,272 --> 02:16:09,261
I was trying to fight the mob!

1501
02:16:10,660 --> 02:16:14,608
You wouldn't dare try to justify
yourself if you knew what I'd loss.

1502
02:16:16,700 --> 02:16:19,589
Have you ever had to talk to the
person you loved most...

1503
02:16:19,611 --> 02:16:22,796
...tell them it's gonna be alright
when you know it's not?

1504
02:16:25,475 --> 02:16:29,730
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1505
02:16:29,755 --> 02:16:34,749
Then, you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1506
02:16:35,914 --> 02:16:41,841
- You're not going to hurt my family.
- No, just the person you love most.

1507
02:16:50,111 --> 02:16:52,568
So, is it your wife?

1508
02:16:54,672 --> 02:16:58,096
Put the gun down, Harvey.
Harvey put down the gun.

1509
02:16:59,540 --> 02:17:02,794
Please. Please, Harvey.
Please.

1510
02:17:04,131 --> 02:17:07,123
Dammit, will you stop pointing
that gun at my family?

1511
02:17:08,394 --> 02:17:09,349
We have a winner...

1512
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:12,095
- No Jimmy, stop him!
- Harvey!

1513
02:17:13,199 --> 02:17:16,953
Harvey! I'm sorry...

1514
02:17:19,655 --> 02:17:21,111
...for everything.

1515
02:17:23,058 --> 02:17:24,878
Please don't hurt my son.

1516
02:17:35,668 --> 02:17:37,124
You brought your cops?

1517
02:17:37,553 --> 02:17:39,271
All they know is there's a situation.

1518
02:17:40,327 --> 02:17:43,478
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1519
02:17:43,520 --> 02:17:45,806
You think I want to escape from this?

1520
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:49,107
There is no escape from this.

1521
02:17:49,150 --> 02:17:51,300
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1522
02:17:53,662 --> 02:17:56,916
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1523
02:17:57,341 --> 02:18:01,857
You thought we could be decent
man in an indecent time.

1524
02:18:04,645 --> 02:18:06,260
Well, you were wrong.

1525
02:18:06,301 --> 02:18:12,661
The world is cruel and the only
morality in a cruel world is chance.

1526
02:18:13,356 --> 02:18:18,874
Unbiased, unprejudiced, fair.

1527
02:18:18,923 --> 02:18:21,380
His son's got the same chance she had.

1528
02:18:22,138 --> 02:18:23,184
50:50.

1529
02:18:23,217 --> 02:18:25,230
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance?

1530
02:18:25,266 --> 02:18:28,315
We decided to act, we three.

1531
02:18:28,739 --> 02:18:32,459
Then, why was it me who was the
only one who lost everything?

1532
02:18:34,466 --> 02:18:35,683
It wasn't.

1533
02:18:35,722 --> 02:18:37,007
The Joker chose me!

1534
02:18:37,615 --> 02:18:39,765
Because you were the best of us.

1535
02:18:39,915 --> 02:18:46,172
He wanted to prove that even
someone as good as you could fall.

1536
02:18:47,139 --> 02:18:48,424
Then, he was right.

1537
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:50,660
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1538
02:18:50,690 --> 02:18:54,171
So, point it at the people responsible.

1539
02:18:55,146 --> 02:18:56,295
Fair enough.

1540
02:18:59,943 --> 02:19:01,592
You first.

1541
02:19:14,197 --> 02:19:15,744
My turn.

1542
02:19:23,196 --> 02:19:28,247
Harvey, wait. Rachel's
death was my fault.

1543
02:19:32,305 --> 02:19:34,250
Please don't punish the boy.

1544
02:19:35,308 --> 02:19:36,764
Please punish me.

1545
02:19:40,490 --> 02:19:42,674
Tell your boy it's gonna be alright, Gordon.

1546
02:19:42,992 --> 02:19:46,678
Lie. Like I lied.

1547
02:19:50,169 --> 02:19:52,160
It's going to be alright, son.

1548
02:20:30,277 --> 02:20:32,962
Dad, is he okay?

1549
02:20:49,477 --> 02:20:50,375
Thank you.

1550
02:20:50,407 --> 02:20:51,760
You don't have to thank me.

1551
02:20:52,258 --> 02:20:53,475
Yes, I do.

1552
02:20:58,454 --> 02:20:59,807
The Joker won.

1553
02:21:01,860 --> 02:21:07,014
Harvey's prosecution, everything
he fought for, undone.

1554
02:21:07,923 --> 02:21:09,936
Whatever chance you got
is of fixing our city...

1555
02:21:10,339 --> 02:21:12,284
...dies with Harvey's reputation.

1556
02:21:13,064 --> 02:21:14,144
We bet it all on him.

1557
02:21:18,339 --> 02:21:19,328
People will lose hope.

1558
02:21:20,485 --> 02:21:21,565
They won't.

1559
02:21:24,583 --> 02:21:26,767
They must never know what he did.

1560
02:21:26,892 --> 02:21:30,544
Five dead, two of them cops?

1561
02:21:30,592 --> 02:21:31,581
You can't sweep that out.

1562
02:21:37,569 --> 02:21:39,787
But The Joker cannot win.

1563
02:21:45,823 --> 02:21:48,644
Gotham needs its true hero.

1564
02:21:55,288 --> 02:21:58,143
- No.
- You either die a hero...

1565
02:21:58,166 --> 02:22:02,421
...or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain.

1566
02:22:03,125 --> 02:22:08,711
I could do those things because
I'm not a hero, unlike Dent.

1567
02:22:11,368 --> 02:22:14,519
I killed those people,
that's what I could be.

1568
02:22:14,537 --> 02:22:16,459
No, no you can't!
You're not!

1569
02:22:16,489 --> 02:22:18,309
Of whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1570
02:22:20,842 --> 02:22:21,888
Call it in.

1571
02:22:25,347 --> 02:22:30,432
A hero. Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1572
02:22:30,653 --> 02:22:35,010
Nothing less than a knight, shining.

1573
02:22:36,013 --> 02:22:41,872
- They'll hunt you.
- You'll hunt me. You'll condemn me.

1574
02:22:43,164 --> 02:22:51,287
Set the dogs on me. Because
that's what needs to happen.

1575
02:22:52,973 --> 02:22:56,522
Because sometimes, truth isn't good enough.

1576
02:22:57,878 --> 02:22:59,664
Sometimes people deserve more.

1577
02:23:03,457 --> 02:23:07,541
Sometimes, people deserve to have
their faith rewarded.

1578
02:23:25,804 --> 02:23:30,730
Batman!
Batman!

1579
02:23:31,810 --> 02:23:33,858
Why's he running, dad?

1580
02:23:35,363 --> 02:23:36,819
Because we have to chase him.

1581
02:23:36,861 --> 02:23:39,580
We're going in! Go, go, move!

1582
02:23:45,379 --> 02:23:46,994
He didn't do anything wrong.

1583
02:23:49,965 --> 02:23:54,789
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1584
02:23:56,633 --> 02:24:02,526
So we'll hunt him, because he can take it.

1585
02:24:05,542 --> 02:24:07,590
Because he's not a hero.

1586
02:24:15,645 --> 02:24:20,070
He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector.

1587
02:24:22,405 --> 02:24:24,054
A dark knight.

1588
02:24:25,305 --> 02:25:25,587
